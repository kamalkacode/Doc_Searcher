Edgbaston Cricket Ground

== Ground ==

Edgbaston is considered to be one of England's leading cricket grounds. Wisden's guide to cricket grounds in 1992 commented that "Lord's is really its only superior in the United Kingdom" with The Daily Telegraph agreeing in 2009 that "taken all in all, it is now the best ground outside Lord's." After the opening of the new South and West Stands in 2011 the England and Wales Cricket Board commented that "the spacious facilities are cutting edge, marginally better than the Home of Cricket".The atmosphere at Edgbaston is reputed to be the most hostile in England for visiting teams. Former England captain Alec Stewart recalled "On a world level I would put it up there with Eden Gardens in Calcutta, which holds about 100,000. It inspires a team. It's like having another man in your side." and the former England wicketkeeper Geraint Jones describes how "The crowd here makes such a big noise when you are doing well ... it's a unique environment." After winning the 2015 Ashes Test Match with Australia at Edgbaston, England captain Alastair Cook commented "The Edgbaston crowd was up there with the loudest I can remember. With some of the chants, even guys who have played a fair bit of cricket were looking at each other and realising how special it was. Edgbaston has been a fantastic venue for us."The record attendance at a County Championship match at Edgbaston is 28,000 against Lancashire in the championship-winning season of 1951, and the record for a single day of a test match is 32,000 against the West Indies in 1957.For some years until 2000, Edgbaston had a distinctive motorized rain cover system, known as the Brumbrella.


=== Stands and spectator facilities ===
South Stand. Built over the site of the previous pavilion in 2011, the stand is a multi-tiered structure which holds the Press Box, hospitality suites, players changing rooms, administration offices, Visitor and Learning Centre, the Club shop and banqueting halls. The South Stand (Pavilion) has a seating capacity of over 4,000 spectators.
West Stand. Built in 2011 on the site of the previous William Ansell Stand, the West Stand has two large tiers of seating. Adjacent to the south is the Edgbaston Suite – a 750-seat banqueting and exhibition space whose bright blue presence is a distinctive feature of both the inside and the outside of the ground – above which facing the pitch is a large electronic scoreboard.
Drayton Manor Family Stand - (Priory Stand). This is the main family stand at Edgbaston and was renamed in 2014 with a sponsorship deal with Drayton Manor Theme Park.  It has a single tier structure and is between the West and Raglan Stands. The environment of this stand is designed to be suitable for families with children.
Raglan Stand. This is a single tier structure and is parallel to the wicket on the opposite side to the Eric Hollies Stand. The Raglan Stand is the location of the Aylesford Hospitality Boxes situated at the rear overlooking the ground.
R. E. S. Wyatt Stand. Built at the City End in 1995 and named after the Warwickshire and England all-rounder Bob Wyatt, who died that year, the R. E. S. Wyatt Stand consists of a single tier of seating beneath two rows of executive boxes. Facilities in the stand include two pitch-view restaurants: the Marston's Suite and the Executive Club, together with the David Heath Suite, currently used by Warwickshire members.
Scrivens (Press Box) Stand. Built in 1957 and first used for that year's test match against the West Indies, this stand was given to the club by Langton Iliffe, 2nd Baron Iliffe and his fellow directors of the Coventry Evening Telegraph. It hosted the ground's press facilities until the opening of the new South Stand in 2011. A two tier stand, it is allocated as an alcohol-free family area for top-class matches. Now named the Scrivens Stand after a sponsorship deal with  Scrivens Opticians.
Stanley Barnes Stand. A small single tier stand opened in 1989, the Stanley Barnes Stand is situated in front of the Thwaite Memorial Scoreboard, the ground's most distinctive feature.
Eric Hollies Stand.  Formerly known as the Rea Bank, after the River Rea which runs immediately to its rear, this is traditionally the most raucous area of the ground. The stand was renamed after the Warwickshire and England leg-spinner Eric Hollies in 1989, and was rebuilt in 2003 with 5,900 seats, an increase of 1,300 over its predecessor. The design, which won a Civic Trust Award in 2003, features a series of eight aluminium sunshades suspended over the single tier of seating on simple steel masts, appearing to hover over the crowd beneath.

=== Other facilities ===
Indoor Cricket Centre. Fronting the Pershore Road side of the ground, the Indoor Cricket Centre was opened by the Duke of Edinburgh in 2000, replacing an earlier indoor cricket school of 1956. Its 41m x 32m main hall accommodates either eight net lanes for indoor cricket practice or two six-a-side pitches. The building also houses a small shop, a bar with an outdoor terrace and offices for regional, youth and disabled cricket boards.
Visitor & Learning Centre. Opened in 2011 and situated on the mezzanine level of the South Stand, the 300m² Visitor & Learning Centre is an interactive display charting the history of Warwickshire County Cricket Club and of test match cricket at Edgbaston. The experience is introduced with a five-minute film giving a short overview of the history of the club and ground in a small theatre area, and includes audio and film records of key moments and figures from Warwickshire's past, and interactive installations demonstrating cricketing techniques and allowing visitors to test their judgement against that of test match umpires. The centre was favourably reviewed by The Independent when it opened in 2011. Commenting on how "the rich history of the club and the ground are told simply, straightforwardly and accessibly", the review concluded by comparing it to the equivalent at Lord's: "The museum at Lord's is cramped and gives an air of scholarly dinginess ... maybe they could learn a lesson or two from Edgbaston now."
Museum and Library. A more traditional museum, housing the club's collection of cricketing memorabilia – one of the largest and most important in the country – and its cricketing library, opened underneath the R. E. S. Wyatt Stand in 2012.
Colts' Ground. On the east side of the River Rea, to the rear of the Eric Hollies Stand, the smaller Colts' Ground is used for cricket practice and minor matches.
