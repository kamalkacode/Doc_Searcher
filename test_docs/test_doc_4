Eden Gardens

== Stadium ==

The Stadium is the headquarters of the Cricket Association of Bengal. Apart from International matches, the stadium hosts matches for domestic Indian cricket and is the home venue for Kolkata Knight Riders. The stadium's Club House is named after former Chief Minister of West Bengal Dr. B. C. Roy.


=== 1987 Renovation ===
Before the 1987 World Cup, the stadium had a capacity of 40,000. It was expanded to 94,000. Renovations included changes to press box, club house and television infrastructure. 42 columns provided the support for large roofs and multi-tiered covered stands. Even after the renovation, not all seats were covered and many sections lacked individual seats.
However, match day attendance of more than 100,000 spectators  have been recorded on at least 6 occasions.


=== 2011 Renovation ===

Eden Gardens underwent renovation for the 2011 Cricket World Cup. Renovation had been undertaken to meet the standards set by the International Cricket Council (ICC) for the 2011 World Cup. The Cricket Association of Bengal retained the team of Burt Hill and VMS to renovate the Eden Gardens Cricket Stadium. The plans for the renovated stadium included a new clubhouse and players' facilities, upgrades of the exterior walls to give the stadium a new look, cladding the existing roof structure with a new metal skin, new/upgraded patron amenities & signage and general infrastructure improvements. The upgrade also meant reduction of the seating capacity to about 90,000 from around 120,000 before the upgrade.
Due to unsafe conditions arising from the incomplete renovations, the ICC withdrew the India vs. England match from the Eden Gardens. This match, scheduled on 27 February 2011, was played in Bengaluru at M.Chinnaswamy Stadium.
The stadium hosted the remaining three scheduled World Cup 2011 Matches on 15, 18 and 20 March 2011. In the last of these three matches (Kenya vs Zimbabwe), the stadium had the minimal ticket-purchasing crowd in its recorded history with 15 spectators having bought tickets.


=== Stands ===
Eden Gardens stands have been named after prominent local cricketers and soldiers. On January 22, 2017, 2 stands were named after Indian cricketers - Sourav Ganguly and Pankaj Roy while 2 more were after cricket administrators - BN Dutt (BCCI President 1988-1990) and Jagmohan Dalmiya (BCCI President 2001-04, 2013 - interim, 2015).

On 27 April 2017, 4 stands were named after Indian soldiers - Colonel Neelakantan Jayachandran Nair, Havildar Hangpan Dada, Lieutenant Colonel Dhan Singh Thapa and Subedar Joginder Singh Sahnan.
