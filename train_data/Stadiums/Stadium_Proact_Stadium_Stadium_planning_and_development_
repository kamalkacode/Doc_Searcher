== Stadium planning and development ==

The Dema Glass site emerged as a possible location in October 2004 at a time when the club were already pursuing planning permission to redevelop Wheeldon Mill, the town's former greyhound stadium. Chesterfield Borough Council viewed the site as part of a masterplan to regenerate the A61 corridor, an area to the north of the town centre and including the Chesterfield Canal. Agreement in principle between the club and local authority was struck in February 2005, though progress faced initial delays.Designs for the proposed new stadium were provided by local architects Ward McHugh Associates who had previously undertaken commissions on the redevelopment of the South Stand at Twickenham and Everton's Goodison Park stadium.Planning permission was granted after a public meeting held on 1 July 2008, with the plans forming part of a wider mixed-use development. The land at the site was handed over to the club in February 2009 and, after decontamination, construction officially started on Thursday 23 July 2009, overseen by GB Development Solutions. Separate buildings which formed part of the overall scheme included a Tesco Extra superstore, Tesco petrol station, a KFC, a Enterprise car rental and other office facilities.The new stadium was handed over to the club in July 2010 and granted its full capacity licence from the Safety Advisory Group after hosting two limited capacity games against Derby County and Barnsley.The stadium can be expanded to a 13,000-seater facility if the corner sections are eventually filled.
