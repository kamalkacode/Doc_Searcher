== History ==


=== Early days ===
Staines Town FC was founded in 1892 and was known under various names including Staines F.C.,Staines Albany F.C., 'Staines Lagonda F.C.', and 'Staines Town F.C.', until it folded in 1935. However prior to World War II the club re-formed as Staines Vale.
In 1953 Staines Town were founder members of the Hellenic League, where they  finished runners-up in 1956. In 1958 they joined the Spartan League and won the title two years later. After finishing second in 1971, Staines Town advanced to the Athenian League, where they won the Second Division title at the first attempt, amassing a record number of points.


=== Isthmian League ===
The club were elected to the new Isthmian League Division One in 1973. In their second season, the club finished top and were promoted to the Premier Division. In a nine-year stay, the club's best finish was fourth. However, a ground grading ruling meant that the club were demoted in 1984. The club bounced back five years later only for its Premier Division status to be lost again in 1993 when the club were relegated for the first time in 63 years. Again the club were promoted in 1996 and again it was quickly lost, with the club returning to Division One after only a year.
Having lobbied Spelthorne Council on and off for 20 years, planning permission for a £6.5m Conference and health facility was granted in April 2000 and finalised a year later. During construction, Staines groundshared with Walton & Hersham and Egham Town before the return to Wheatsheaf Lane (now shared with the Thames Club) on 22 February 2003.
During 2002–03 and 2003–04, Staines played in Division One South of the Isthmian League and on the last day of season 2003–04, under Steve Cordery, they secured a place in the Premier Division in the newly re-structured pyramid. The Swans spent five seasons in this division before winning promotion to the Conference South in 2009. They had finished second in the league and therefore gained promotion through the play-offs, beating Carshalton Athletic 1–0 in the final at Wheatsheaf Park on 2 May 2009. Louis Wells saved a Carshalton penalty in the 85th minute with Scott Taylor scoring the winning goal in extra time. Staines had also finished as runners up in the previous season, but had lost 2–1 to AFC Wimbledon in the playoff final after taking a first half lead but conceding two late goals in the last seven minutes.


=== Life in the Conference South ===
The 2009–10 campaign marked the Swans' first ever appearance in the Conference South and they began their journey brightly, defeating Weston-Super-Mare 0–1 and Dorchester Town 3–0. A home defeat, 1–2, to Havant & Waterlooville was then followed by five consecutive draws and then a 1–3 victory away at St. Albans City. Two significant victories in late October 2009 were beating first place, and at the time unbeaten, Newport County 1–0 at home followed four days later beating third place Thurrock 1–2 away. On Boxing Day 2009, Staines won 4–1 away to rivals Hampton and Richmond Borough, following this up by beating them 4–0 at the Wheatsheaf on New Years Day 2010, with Ali Chaaban scoring a hat-trick. Another significant victory was away at Chelmsford, winning 0–1 through a Marc Charles-Smith goal, Charles-Smith's third goal in a little over 48 hours having scored twice at Dorchester only two days previously. Steve Cordery was named the Conference South manager of the month for January, 2010. Despite a magnificent February and March when Staines Town were in the play-off places, they finished in a very creditable eighth place in their first season in the Conference South.


=== Cup history ===
The club have reached the FA Cup first round proper on six occasions, in 1879, 1880, 1984 (losing 2–0 at a Neil Warnock-managed Burton Albion), 2007, 2009 and 2015. In 2007 Staines were drawn away against League Two outfit Stockport County. A crowd of 3,460 saw Staines go behind to a Matty McNeil header but a 76th-minute equaliser from Charles-Smith earned a replay. It was announced on 12 November that the replay would be shown on Sky Sports, resulting in a £75,000 windfall for each club. Staines Town completed the improbable upset as they won the match in penalty kicks (4–3, two magnificent saves by Swans goalkeeper Shaun Allaway, the winning penalty scored by Dave Sargent) after drawing 1–1 in extra time, after having taken the lead in the eighth minute with an Adrian Toppin goal. In the next round they faced Peterborough United at home, and were beaten 5–0. Sir Alex Ferguson (father of Peterborough manager Darren) and Sir Trevor Brooking were among the guests of Staines Town FC on the day.
On 7 November 2009 they beat League Two Shrewsbury Town 0–1 at the Prostar Stadium, Shrewsbury in the 1st Round proper of the F.A. Cup to reach the second round of the competition. The Second Round draw saw Staines Town drawn at home to the winners of the following evening's First Round game of Millwall vs AFC Wimbledon, which Millwall won 4–1.
On 28 November 2009 they earned a place in the 3rd Round Draw for the first time ever after a 1–1 draw against League One Millwall, Ali Chaaban scoring a 79th-minute penalty to level the score after having gone behind ten minutes earlier, in front of a 2,753 crowd. The replay at the New Den was on 9 December and was broadcast live on the FA.com website. A home tie against Championship side Derby County in the 3rd Round awaited the winners of the replay, which Millwall won 4–0.
There have been two appearances in the last 32 of the FA Trophy, the first back in 1976, losing to Morecambe in a 2nd replay and then in a replay to Halifax Town in 2004 after drawing 1–1 at The Shay in the first match.
Another significant match in the club's history was in 1975 when they beat Italian Amateur cup winners Banco di Roma 3–0 on aggregate (1-0 in Rome, 2-0 in Wheatsheaf Lane) for the Barassi Cup.
Staines have also lifted the Middlesex Senior Cup on no fewer than ten occasions. In 1997 under Chris Wainwright, beating Yeading in a penalty shoot out, whilst the Middlesex Charity Cup was lifted in 1994 with a 4–0 win over Northwood. The latest victory in the Middlesex Senior Cup was in 2013 with a 2–0 win over Ashford Town (Middx).
The Carlsberg Cup (an Isthmian League tournament now abolished) was lifted in 1995 against Boreham Wood where the Swans scored a last minute equaliser from the last ever experimental 'kick in' in English football.
In the London Senior Cup, Staines were runners up in both 1977 and 1981, the earlier final went to a replay versus Wimbledon which 'The Dons' won in their last ever match as a non-League club.
