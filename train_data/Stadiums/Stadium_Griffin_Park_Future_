=== Brentford Community Stadium ===
In August 1973, the Middlesex Chronicle reported that the club had submitted a bid to Hounslow Council to build a new ground and leisure complex on the site of Brentford Market.Brentford's hopes of moving to a new 20,000-capacity stadium were boosted in 2007 after the club was given an option to buy a 7.6-acre (31,000 m2) site at Lionel Road, less than a mile away from Griffin Park. The project was halted in 2010 due to the economic downturn and partners Barratt Homes pulled out of the deal in January 2011. In June 2012, the club bought the Lionel Road site from Barratt Homes. Outline planning approval was given by the London Borough of Hounslow on 5 December 2013, with the Mayor of London's office giving their approval in February 2014. Eric Pickles (then-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government) gave final approval for the stadium on 14 March 2014 and a development agreement was signed with Willmott Dixon in December 2014.The commencement of work on the Lionel Road site was held up through 2015 due to First Industrial Ltd (which owned the final parcel of land needed to begin development) objecting to a compulsory purchase order by Hounslow Council. Hounslow Council completed the acquisition of the land in September 2016 and on-site preparation for construction began in late March 2017. Ground was broken at the site on 19 March 2018 and as of August 2018, the club is expected to move into the stadium during the 2020 off-season.


=== Griffin Park ===
Brentford's 5th-place finish in the Championship playoff places in the 2014–15 season raised questions about Griffin Park's suitability for Premier League football, prior to the then-expected move to the Community Stadium in 2017. Chief executive Mark Devlin explained that should improvements to Griffin Park to meet Premier League standards not be viable, Brentford would look to groundshare with another club in the vicinity. By May 2015, Stamford Bridge, Wembley Stadium and Twickenham Stoop were ruled out as potential venues and West London neighbours Queens Park Rangers and Fulham refused to comment. In May 2015, it was revealed that it would cost £3 million to upgrade Griffin Park to meet Premier League specifications. On 3 September 2015, Hounslow Council approved the building of 75 new homes on the site of Griffin Park, after the club moves out. Brentford were given special dispensation by the Sports Ground Safety Authority to retain the terracing in the Ealing Road and Brook Road stands for the 2017–18 and 2018–19 seasons, due to the club's good safety record over the previous seasons in the Championship and its impending move to the Community Stadium.
