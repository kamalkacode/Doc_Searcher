In 1958 the ground played host to a visit from Queen Elizabeth II. A major rock concert was staged at the ground in May 1966 which featured the Who, the Kinks and the Small Faces. Sincil Bank has played host to many sports including local cricket finals, boxing, wrestling, athletics, cycling, lawn tennis and American football.
On the weekend of 19/20 May 2006, the Irish pop band Westlife and other supporting acts including Liberty X, Blue's Lee Ryan and Journey South performed in front of over 13,000 fans at Sincil Bank - the biggest concert ever to take place in the city of Lincoln. The event was organised by both Lincoln City and the City Council, with funding and profits being shared between the two. The club actually recorded a Â£44,000 loss but said Sincil Bank had been put back on the map for future live events. Since a Bonfire Night 2006 live event has been held, and though on a much smaller scale (over 5,000 spectators), it featured several artists such as Lee Ryan again, former Steps star Lisa Scott-Lee's brother Andy Scott-Lee, Icelandic outfit Nylon and 2ToGo of X-Factor fame.
