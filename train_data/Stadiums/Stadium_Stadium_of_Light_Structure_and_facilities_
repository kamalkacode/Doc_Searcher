The stadium is in the shape of a square bowl, and is separated into the West Stand, North Stand, East Stand (formerly the Vaux Stand, the Carling Stand, and Fosters Stand respectively), and the South Stand (also known as the Metro FM Stand). The West Stand includes the mothballed Premier Concourse which is the name of the upper tier that was closed at the end of the 2017/18 season  , and a number of executive boxes. The North Stand also includes an upper tier, called the Strongbow Upper, which contained the exterior seating for the Black Cats Bar. When the away fans were relocated, the Black Cats Bar seating was relocated at the rear of the lower tier.The pitch is several metres below the level of the ground outside the stadium. The pitch uses a lighting system from Stadium Grow Lighting to ensure the grass can grow at any time of year. The device controls various aspects of the pitch, including exposure to light, temperature, water, and air, to make the grass able to grow in any conditions. Away fans were seated in the west half of the South Stand when the ground opened in 1997, but in 2012, Ellis Short decided to move away fans to the Upper Tier of the North Stand  The East Stand has the Sunderland emblem on the seats, while the North Stand has the slogan "Ha'way The Lads". The stadium also has a Davy lamp monument, and a statue of Bob Stokoe. The perimeter walls of the stadium incorporate a "Wall of Fame" feature, where names can be engraved into the bricks of the walls. The interior of the stadium holds a banqueting suite, which can seat from 460 to 600 people. The stadium also contains several conferencing suites, that can be hired for events.
