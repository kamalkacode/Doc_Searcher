The St Mary's Stadium has hosted one full England international match, a 2–2 draw between England and Macedonia in October 2002, while Wembley Stadium was out of action due to redevelopment and the Football Association decided that England games would be played at various venues around the country. David Beckham and Steven Gerrard scored for England. There has also been an international between Japan and Nigeria.
The stadium first hosted European football in September 2003, when the Saints faced Romanian side Steaua Bucharest in the first round of the UEFA Cup. The game ended in a 1–1 draw.
In 2016, Southampton had their first venture in the UEFA Europa League and their first game against Czech side Sparta Prague ended in a 3-0 win. Later in the group stage, they faced former champions Inter Milan and won 2-1.
The venue hosted two England under-21 internationals. The first was a 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification Group 3 match against the Republic of Ireland’s under-21s on November 20, 2008. The hosts thrashed the visitors 3 - 0 thanks to Stephen O'Halloran’s sixtieth minute own goal followed by James Milner’s sixty eighth-minute goal and Theo Walcott’s seventy eighth-minute goal with  31,473 in attendance. The other was an international friendly against Norway’s under-21s on March 28, 2011. The hosts beat the visitors 2 - 0 with goals from Daniel Sturridge on the ninth minute and Danny Rose on the fortieth minute with 18,000 in attendance.
