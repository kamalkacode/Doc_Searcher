== Naming ==

In 2002, former Leicester City shirt sponsors Walkers signed a ten-year deal for naming rights. The agreement was superseded halfway through the period, in May 2007, when they again paid a "seven-figure sum" to extend their sponsorship of the stadium until 2017. Originally the ground was to have been called the "Walkers Bowl," but the name was dropped after fans objected on the grounds the name was too "American" (referring to the American college football bowl game concept). As a result of a fans' petition, the name was quickly changed to the "Walkers Stadium"; however, some fans were still unhappy the name only referenced the sponsor, with no Leicester City reference, such as "Filbert," "Fosse" or "Foxes". Consequently, the stadium was sometimes derogatorily referred to (by both Home and Away supporters) as the "crisp bowl," in reference to Walkers best-known products. The naming rights were sold to King Power for the 2011â€“12 season.
Some fans refer to the stadium as Filbert Way after the ground's address, retaining a link with the past, while others refer to the ground as Freeman's Wharf, after the area of the city in which the stadium is situated. During the 2015 Rugby World Cup and UEFA Champions League matches, the stadium is known as the Leicester City Stadium.
