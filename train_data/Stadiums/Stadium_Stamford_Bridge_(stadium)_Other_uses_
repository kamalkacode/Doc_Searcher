Stamford Bridge was the venue of the FA Cup Final from 1920 to 1922, before being replaced by Wembley Stadium in 1923. It has staged ten FA Cup semi-finals, ten Charity Shield matches, and three England matches, the last in 1932. It was one of the home venues for the representative London XI team that played in the original Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. The team played the home leg of the two-legged final at Stamford Bridge, drawing 2–2 with FC Barcelona; they lost the away leg 6–0, however.

Stamford Bridge has also hosted a variety of other sporting events since Chelsea have occupied the ground. In October 1905 it hosted a rugby union match between the All Blacks and Middlesex, and in 1914 hosted a baseball match between the touring New York Giants and the Chicago White Sox. In 1908, Stamford Bridge was the venue for a Rugby League international between Great Britain and the touring New Zealand All Golds, who won 18-6. In 1924 the stadium hosted the 1924 Women's Olympiad, the first international event for women in track and field in the UK. A speedway team operated from the stadium from 1929 until 1932, winning the Southern League in their opening season. Initially open meetings were held there in 1928. A nineteen-year-old junior rider, Charlie Biddle, was killed in a racing accident. In 1931, black cinders were laid onto the circuit suitable for use by speedway and athletics. A midget car meeting reportedly attracted a crowd of 50,000 people in 1948.The ground was used in 1980 for the first major day-night floodlit cricket match between Essex and West Indies (although organised by Surrey) which was a commercial success; the following year it hosted the final of the inaugural Lambert & Butler county cricket competition. It, however, failed and the experiment of playing cricket on football grounds was ended. Stamford Bridge briefly hosted American football – despite not being long enough for a regulation-size gridiron field – when the London Monarchs were based there in 1997.


=== Greyhound racing ===
The Greyhound Racing Association (GRA) brought greyhound racing to Stamford Bridge in 1933 and this forced the London Athletic Club to leave the venue.
The track was 434 yards in circumference and was described as a fast, average sized course with short 80-yard straights and banked bends of wide radius. The rails showed a slight advantage and the greyhounds were housed at the Hook estate in Northaw. Track success included the 1935 & 1938 Pall Mall Stakes winners Shove Halfpenny and Roeside Creamery respectively. Events at Stamford Bridge included the Chelsea Cup which in 1936 was won by Creamery Border who set a then a new world record of 28.01sec for 500 yards. In addition to the Chelsea Cup the Stamford Bridge Produce Stakes was inaugurated in 1936.Roving Youth trained by Arthur Jonas reached the 1940 English Greyhound Derby final and in 1944 Ballyhennessy Seal recorded 27.64sec for the 500 yards setting a new world and national record. Totalisator turnover in 1946 was nearly £6 million (£5,749,592), to put this in perspective to football, the British transfer record at the same time in 1946 was £14,500.
In 1947 the greyhound meetings offered two members clubs and six refreshment buffets around the terracing and the resident trainers in 1965 consisted of Hancox, Morse, Forster, Sid Mann, Dick Clark and Jim Singleton. With the formation of the Bookmakers Afternoon Greyhound Service in 1967 the National Greyhound Racing Society named Stamford Bridge as one of the tracks to host the service. This meant racing was changed to Thursday afternoons at 2.30pm with just one evening meeting remaining on Saturday at 6.15pm.On 1 August 1968 the GRA closed Stamford Bridge to greyhound racing quoting the fact that Stamford Bridge had to race on the same days as White City. An attempt by Chelsea to bring back greyhound racing to Stamford Bridge in 1976, to alleviate debts, failed when the GRA refused them permission to do so.
