The stadium's official capacity is 12,500 (Currently 11,840 due to segregation in the Les Hart Stand.). The South Stand is the largest stand and it was renamed the "Les Hart Stand" in the summer of 2010.
The stand contains a pattern of blue and white seats that spell out "SHAKERS"
After the Taylor Report forced all Football League clubs to switch to all-seater stadiums, the stadium began converting all four sides of the ground in 1993, with the Cemetery End being the final terraced section to be demolished in 1999.
The Manchester Road End (capacity 2,100) was home to the club's electronic scoreboard (obtained from Leicester City's Filbert Street ground after it closed in 2002) until 2011. A new scoreboard was placed in the south-east corner of the ground a few months later.The Cemetery End (the east stand) has capacity of 2,500.
In September 2015 a screen was installed in the right-hand side of the Les Hart Stand. On Match-Days the club show advertisements, match highlights and the scoreline.
Towards the end of the 2015â€“16 season, a fence was constructed between the Cemetery End and the Les Hart Stand in an attempt to stop the club's rise of hooliganism. This further separates both Home and Away supporters.
