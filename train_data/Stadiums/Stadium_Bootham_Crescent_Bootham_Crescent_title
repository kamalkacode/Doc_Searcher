Bootham Crescent is a sports stadium in York, North Yorkshire, England, and is the home of association football club York City and rugby league club York City Knights. With a capacity of 8,256, the ground is located near the centre of the city, just over a mile from York railway station.
York City leased land at Bootham Crescent from York Cricket Club as a replacement for their ground at Fulfordgate, which was on the outskirts of the city. The ground was constructed in four months, and officially opened on 31 August 1932. During the Second World War, the Popular Stand was converted into an air-raid shelter, and the ground suffered slight damage when a bomb landed on houses along the Shipton Street End. York purchased Bootham Crescent for £4,075 in September 1948. Floodlights were fitted at the ground in 1959, and were replaced by ones twice as powerful in 1995. A number of improvements were made in the early 1980s, with a gymnasium, offices and a lounge for officials built.
The David Longhurst Stand opened in 1991 after a roof was erected on the Shipton Street End. It was named after the former York player David Longhurst, who died during a match at the ground in 1990. Bootham Crescent hosted football in the Football League from 1932 to 2004 and from 2012 to 2016, both spells ending after York were relegated into non-League football. The ground was renamed KitKat Crescent from 2005 to 2010 as part of a sponsorship deal with Nestlé. York are expected to move to a community stadium at Monks Cross in Huntington in mid 2019, and the Bootham Crescent site will be used for housing.
Bootham Crescent comprises four stands: the Main Stand, the Popular Stand, the David Longhurst Stand and the Grosvenor Road End. The ground has held a league representative match, neutral club matches, and schoolboy and youth international matches. Other than football, it has hosted a concert, a grand firework display, American football and rugby league matches and beer festivals. The record attendance of 28,123 was set in March 1938, for an FA Cup match against Huddersfield Town. The highest seasonal average attendance of 10,412 was achieved in 1948–49.
