=== Kingston & Surbiton YMCA ===
Kingstonian was formed in autumn 1885, under the name Kingston & Surbiton YMCA. In the period, rugby was the dominant sport in the town, but the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) was unable to support a rugby club. This influenced their decision to create a club to play "Football under Association rules". The new club played their first fixture on 28 November 1885 losing 3–1 to Surbiton Hill with home games played at Bushey Park before moving to the Spring grove the following season. Over the two years the club played only friendly matches against other football teams in the region.


=== Saxons F.C. ===
In 1887 the club changed its name to Saxons FC and opened up its membership to players who were not also members of the YMCA.  The club however maintained its links to the YMCA and only allowed YMCA members to serve on the decision making committee. In the Summer of 1888 William Carn, the founder of the club, resigned from the YMCA after tensions developed where the YMCA were concerned that the organization was becoming more like a sporting club than a religious organization.  As non YMCA members were not allowed to serve on the committee this would have meant Carn also resigning his duties with the club.  The members decided however to sever links with the YMCA which allowed Carn to continue.  At the same time the club also moved to a ground in Oil Mill Lane (modern day Villiers Road).


=== Kingston Wanderers F.C. ===

At the club's annual general meeting in 1890, the secretary at the time, William G. Carn, proposed that the name became "one more identified with the town". His proposal was successful, and the club became Kingston Wanderers F.C. in the 1890–91 season. The club's first season as Kingston Wanderers also heralded a change of home ground to the Fairfield Recreation Ground.


=== Kingston-on-Thames A.F.C. ===
In the Summer of 1893, the association clubs of Kingston considered a proposal to amalgamate and produce one larger club that would represent the whole town. Because many of the clubs had already arranged fixtures for the coming season it was only Kingston Wanderers who moved forward with the plan, although several other clubs were to amalgamate with them in future seasons. On 13 September 1893, the club changed its name to Kingston-on-Thames A.F.C. They entered the Surrey Junior Cup affiliated to the Surrey Football Association. The first competitive match in Kingston's history was in November 1893 and resulted in a loss, after a replayed game, to Hampton Court & East Molesey.When Kingston-on-Thames ventured into the Surrey Senior Cup in 1894, the heaviest loss of the club to date was recorded, a 13–0 loss to Weybridge F.C. The club re-entered the Surrey Junior Cup and in 1896 joined the Kingston & District League as founder members. In their first season, they won the league but lost the Surrey Junior Cup 2–1 in the final, to Chertsey F.C. after a replay. They spent two years in the Kingston and District league, coming runners up to Brentford 'A' Team in their second season before moving into the East and West Surrey League at the start of the 1898–1899 season. The club also underwent several ground changes during this period and from 1898–1899 season spent 3 years at Dinton Road before one season playing at Lower Marsh Lane in 1901–1902 season.  In 1902–1903 they made a final move to Thorpe Road which was virtually on the site of the Richmond Road ground that was to become their home for much of the Twentieth Century. The club continued to compete in the East and West Surrey League and also had a one-season foray into the London League in 1903 alongside the East and West Surrey League but the "experiment" backfired with fixture congestion and selection difficulties caused by having too many games and Kingston-on-Thames withdrew from the London League after one season. In 1905–1906 season, the club won the newly renamed West Surrey League, a feat which was replicated in 1906–1907 season. In addition the 1906–1907 season saw them finish runners up in the Surrey Senior Cup which was lost to Clapham F.C. 3–1.


=== Old Kingstonians ===
The newfound success in Surrey amateur football was soon lost when the club split before the start of the 1908–09 season after increasing tensions between the First Team members and the "A" Team members. This reached a head after elections for representation on the committee that ran the club. This resulted in treasurer David Judd forming Old Kingstonians F.C. and taking much of the first team with him to a new ground at Norbiton. Kingston-on-Thames continued to compete on the old ground at Thorpe Road, and were made up of the former members of the "A" team as well as two members of the first team who chose to stay. Judd's team became known as the "OK's", the "Rupert's" or the "Juddites" while the Kingston-On-Thames team was known as "The Boys" or simply "The Town club". Initially Kingston-on-Thames had the upper hand both in league and cup success and in matches between the two clubs. To some extent this justified the belief of the former "A" Team members that they were the better team despite effectively representing the club at a lower Junior level than the first team. It also somewhat justified their opinion that the first team had been holding back progress at the club. Gradually however Old Kingstonians improved, winning the West Surrey League in 1910, followed by the Surrey Senior Cup in both 1911 and 1914 and the Southern Suburban League in the two seasons before the war.By the start of World War One, Old Kingstonians held a definite supremacy of the two clubs, and in 1913–1914 won three trophies including the Southern Suburban League and Surrey Senior Cup.  The rivalry between these two clubs was intense and to some extent the competition helped both clubs with their standard of football and improvements to facilities. However there were occasions in which this rivalry spilled over into more serious incidents. Over the period of the split several appeals had been made by both clubs concerning eligibility of players in matches between the two sides, and in two cases the result of the game was overturned. In the 1913–1914 season the Surrey Charity Shield match between the two clubs saw a number of incidents involving players and spectators and this led to the Surrey FA taking responsibility for the running of the replay with warning notices posted at the ground and a large police presence. An FA enquiry into incidents at the first game led to one of the witnesses being attacked on their return to Kingston after giving evidence. Both teams competed in the West Surrey League in 1908–1909 but in 1909–1910 season Kingston-on-Thames FC moved into the Southern Suburban League with Old Kingstonians remaining in the West Surrey League. Kingston-on-Thames did however again try a failed "experiment" by re-entering two first teams in both the Southern Suburban League and West Surrey League for the 1910–1911 season but again this resulted in selection problems and was dropped at the end of the season.  At the start of the 1911–1912 season Old Kingstonians also moved to the Southern Suburban League where both teams stayed until the outbreak of World War One.


=== World War One ===
At the outbreak of World War One, Kingston-on-Thames FC immediately cancelled all football.  However Old Kingstonians did attempt to continue playing despite heavy political pressure to stop.  The club had joined the Athenian League and played two games before the league was cancelled.  They also played three rounds in the FA Cup Qualifying stages before losing to Redhill. They then joined the Metropolitan League which had been set up for wartime football and also played in the London Senior Cup (losing to Walthamstow Grange) and were entered for the F.A. Amateur Cup.  However. despite resisting political pressure, attendances dropped and in December 1914 the club announced that it was ceasing activities.


=== Kingstonian F.C. ===
In 1919 football was rejuvenated in Kingston. The war had dimmed the rivalry between the teams, and they re-united as Kingstonian F.C. Their first match after unification was on 6 September 1919 competing in the Athenian League against Southall F.C. However, the season was plagued with issues regarding their home ground at Richmond Road and a finish in the bottom half of the league meant the team were forced to apply to re-enter the league. Their application was successful, and heralded a change of fortunes for Kingstonian. Before the 1920–1921 season it seemed they had lost their ground after confusion over their desire to renew the rent.  This meant that Leyland Motors had been given exclusive use but an agreement was reached to allow for a groundshare with Leyland Motors and Leyland Motors took over the fixtures of the Kingstonian Reserve team who had signed up for the Southern Suburban League.  The following season Kingstonian were successful in purchasing the Richmond Road ground, although the groundshare arrangement with Leyland Motors continued. They had a more successful spell from 1923 up to the outbreak of World War II, winning the league in 1924, and in 1926 with a record amount of points. The club progressed to several finals of the London and Surrey Senior Cups.In 1929, Kingstonian were successful in their application to join the Isthmian League after the withdrawal of Civil Service F.C. In 1933, Kingstonian won the FA Amateur Cup, they won the League in 1934 and 1937, and the club won the Surrey Senior Cup in 1935 and 1939. "Competitive Amateur Football" was called off in September 1939 for World War II and Kingstonian were to play only one game at the start of the 1939/1940 season. Their ground was requistioned by the Civil Defence for the duration of the war and no further games were played until 1945. Depleted of the majority of their pre-war players, Kingstonian came last in the first league after the war in 1945-1946 season, and had to resort to fundraising to gather money to renovate both the stadium and the changing rooms. In 1949, the all-time top goalscorer Johnny Whing arrived at the club, and was top scorer in nine different seasons for the club. In 1955, Kingstonian's heaviest ever home defeat, 12–3, was recorded at the hands of Bishop Auckland FC in front of the club's record attendance of 8,960.In the 1959–60 season, the K's had their first Wembley Stadium appearance in the FA Amateur Cup final, which was lost to Hendon F.C. 2–1. In 1963, Kingstonian won the double; the Surrey and London Senior Cup. The 1970s were a period of decline for the club, and despite becoming professional in 1975, they were relegated to Division One in 1979. In 1985 Kingstonian were once again promoted to the Isthmian League, finishing second. In 1987, 20 years without silverware was ended by the K's winning the London Senior Cup.Kingstonian won the Isthmian League in 1998 and the FA Trophy in 1999 and 2000 at Wembley Stadium under manager Geoff Chapple, and then managed to reach the fourth round of the FA Cup in 2001. Entering the competition at the Fourth Qualifying Round, they beat Devizes Town before beating two Football League clubs – Brentford and Southend United, either side of a win over fellow Conference team Southport – on their way to the FA Cup fourth round, where they were drawn with Bristol City before succumbing to a late winner in the replay, losing  1–0.Relegation and financial problems saw a sharp downturn in the club's fortunes between 2001 and 2005, and in 2003 the then manager Kim Harris said that the owner Rajesh Khosla was "raping us", after Khosla sold the Kingstonian ground for £2 million in personal profit. However, in February 2005 Khosla stepped down as chairman, selling the club to Jimmy Cochrane, whilst making a profit. While this did not save Kingstonian from relegation that year, the 2005–06 season saw Kingstonian Football Club revitalised. They only narrowly missed out on the promotion playoffs and finished their season by beating AFC Wimbledon in the final of the Surrey Senior Cup at Woking's ground by one goal to nil.Changes continued during mid-2006 with Mark Anderson and Malcolm Winwright taking charge of the club, installing Stuart McIntyre as successor to Ian McDonald in the role of head coach. However, McIntyre's stay in the role was brief and "unsuccessful", with he himself being replaced by Alan Dowson at the start of 2007. Under Dowson the club was promoted back to the Isthmian Premier in 2009. However, after the 2013–14 Isthmian League in which Kingstonian finished second but missed out on promotion, on 11 May 2014 Dowson resigned, being replaced by Tommy Williams.
