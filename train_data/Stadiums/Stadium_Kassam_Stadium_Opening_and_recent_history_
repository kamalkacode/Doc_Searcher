== Opening and recent history ==

The stadium is officially owned by one of Kassam's Firoka Group companies, and hosted its first football match on 4 August 2001. The game was a friendly match against Crystal Palace, which Oxford won on penalties following a 1–1 draw, and Paul Powell scored the club's first goal at the ground. The first competitive match at the ground took place one week later, on 11 August, against Rochdale, in the Football League Third Division (now Football League Two). United lost this match 2–1 in front of a crowd of 7,842 people; Jamie Brooks scored for Oxford. Since then, the ground has hosted rugby union games, as well as an under-17 International football tournament in 2002.
In March 2006, the Oxford United Supporters' Trust unofficially renamed the ground "The United Stadium". They urged everyone to use this name, which they claimed signified the crisis at the club, with the Chairman failing to choose the right option to take the club forward, and which also symbolised the unity of the fans. Despite the unofficial renaming of the stadium, it seems most fans and local press still refer to the home ground as the Kassam Stadium.

At the 2008 Annual General Meeting, club chairman Nick Merry said "The price is agreed for the stadium at £13 million. That is not negotiable but the valuation of the stadium is some way short of that so funding that deficit needs to make commercial sense. We are not prepared to put the future of Oxford United at risk. Any deal has to make sense for both the short term and long term future of this club."On 16 May 2012, rugby union club London Welsh applied to move their home ground to the Kassam Stadium following promotion from the RFU Championship, and their opening Premiership fixture was played there on 2 September 2012. The rugby club returned to their former home, Old Deer Park in Richmond-upon-Thames, after relegation from the Premiership at the end of the 2014–15 season.


=== Records ===
The attendance record at the Kassam Stadium is 12,243. This was for Oxford's final match of the 2005–06 League Two season, a 3–2 defeat by Leyton Orient that sealed their relegation from the Football League. It beat the previous record of 12,177 for a 3–0 League Cup defeat by Aston Villa on 6 November 2002. During the summer of 2006, Oxford United hosted Manchester United in a friendly game that attracted 11,463 people, and on Boxing Day, 2006, the ground held a Conference Premier record attendance of 11,065 for the 0–0 draw against Woking.  This was surpassed during the play-off 2nd leg on 3 May 2010, where the attendance was 11,963 for the visit of Rushden & Diamonds. In January 2016, a crowd of 11,673 watched a 3–2 FA Cup win against Swansea City, which was the biggest home gate for almost four years.
On 24 July 2006, Sir Elton John played a concert to a sold-out 17,500 crowd.
In 2006–07, when Oxford led the Conference National for most of the season before being overhauled by Dagenham & Redbridge and then being eliminated from the playoffs by Exeter City, the average attendance at the Kassam Stadium was 6,332. However, with Oxford's worse form in 2007–08 the average attendance slumped sharply to 4,728. Despite Oxford once again finishing mid-table in 2008–09 attendances rose marginally and the average attendance of that campaign was 4,879. Promotion back to the Football League was achieved via the playoffs in 2009–10, during which Oxford's average attendance enjoyed a dramatic rise and narrowly exceeded the 6,000 mark.
