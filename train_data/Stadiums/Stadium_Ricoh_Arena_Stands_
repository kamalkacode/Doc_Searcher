=== Alan Higgs Charity Stand ===
When the ground first opened, the stand was known as the Coventry Evening Telegraph stand and was the main stand for Coventry City supporters that sung during games. After the sponsorship deal ran out for the stand, it became known as the North Stand but then renamed again after the Wasps' purchase of the Alan Higgs Charity share of Arena Coventry Limited. Coventry City announced that for the 2015/16 season that the stand would be closed for football matches due to costs but will be opened if the demand is there, however tickets can still be brought there for Wasps' fixtures.


=== West Stand ===
The only two-tier stand at the Stadium, it consists of a larger lower tier below the upper tier, which consists of corporate hospitality boxes. Also situated on this side of the stadium are hotel rooms, which have a view of the pitch. In the corner between this stand and the South Stand is a Police control box. This is the only stand that offers cushioned seats and it also provides seating for directors as well as the media.


=== East Stand ===
The East Stand provides a video screen in the corner by the South Stand, this corner soon became known as the Singers' corner to Coventry fans as first called by Aidy Boothroyd, when he was manager of the Sky Blues. This is where the main cameras are positioned for the highlights of fixtures as well as the televised fixtures. The stand as been formerly known as the NTL stand and the Tesco Stand.


=== South Stand ===
This stand is used for Away Supports for football matches and only opens for Rugby matches when needed due to extra demand. However the stand has opened for home supporters in the past for Coventry City fixtures for fixtures against Gillingham and Crewe Alexandra as there was heavy demand by the home support but there was no large followings from the away side. Clubs such as Chelsea, West Ham United, Leicester City, Wolves and Leeds United have sold out the stand in the past. The stand has had previous names in the past, due to sponsors.
