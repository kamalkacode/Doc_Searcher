== History ==
The ground was initially the home of Maidenhead Cricket Club and it was with their kind permission that shortly after the football club began in 1870, Maidenhead played their first match at York Road on 16 February 1871 against Marlow. The Magpies have continued to play home matches here, without a break, to the present day.
The current capacity of the ground is 4,000 (550 seated) and holds a "B" grading. The club's record attendance is 7,989 for the 1936 FA Amateur Cup quarter-final against Southall. A further 2,000 spectators are estimated to have watched the match from the adjacent railway embankment. The ground record attendance was set on Easter Monday 1947 when 8,277 people paid total receipts of Â£494 to watch the Berks & Bucks Senior Cup Final between Slough Town and Wycombe Wanderers.
The ground facilitates fans in a mixture of covered all-seater stands, covered and uncovered traditional terraces and flat concrete by the side of the pitch. As well as the normal facilities for lower-league football, the ground hosts Stripes Bar which can be hired out for functions. The ground is located just a few minutes walk away from the town centre and from Maidenhead railway station.
