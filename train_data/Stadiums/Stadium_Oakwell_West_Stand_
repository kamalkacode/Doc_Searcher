== West Stand ==

The West Stand is the only original part of Oakwell Stadium left standing; however, it was made 'all-seater' in 1995.
The stand is made up of two tiers, with only the upper tier covered, but at the expense of several supporting columns for the roof structure. The seats are the originals from the early 1900s, and from here you get a decent view with moderate legroom. In spite of the restricted views and modest facilities, the West Stand remains a popular vantage point for many fans. The lower tier of the West Stand is uncovered and offers a great view of the action.
The roof of the West Stand is corrugated iron. This also houses the main television gantry, which is accessed from the upper tier seating area by a temporary ladder.
At the end of the 1990s, the then stadium owners Barnsley Football Club were considering re-developing the West Stand after several seasons of high attendances; however, with the rapid decline in fortunes of the football club, subsequent sale of the stadium and new club ownership, these plans are unlikely to come to fruition in the near future.
The stand also incorporates a traditional players' tunnel in the centre. While this is used for access to some of the facilities underneath the stand, the main players' tunnel now feeds out from the north-west corner, following the relocation of the changing rooms to the North Stand.
The West Stand has a total seating capacity of 4,752.
