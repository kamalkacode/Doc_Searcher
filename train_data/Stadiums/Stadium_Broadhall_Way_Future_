In April 2011, Stevenage chairman Phil Wallace confirmed that the club were looking for investment to re-develop the North Stand, which can only currently hold a capacity of 700 people. The new plans involved a 2,000 all-seater stand that Wallace "wants to signify Boro's transition from a former non-league outfit to that of an ambitious, forward-thinking Football League club". It was stated that the new build would look similar to the South Stand from within the stadium — except for being "a few rows deeper". In January 2013, it was announced that the club were due to present plans to replace the existing North Terrace with a new £1.2 million 1,700 seat stand, although these did not materialise due to "numerous obstacles put in the way".In July 2017, the club asked fans to contribute towards a mini-bond investment scheme in an attempt to fund the remaining £500,000 needed to go towards developing the new North Stand. The mini-bond would earn investors interest on a six-month basis, and is "effectively a loan to the football club which will attract interest at the rate of 4% per year, or fans can opt to double that rate and take an 8% credit". The club stated its desire to open the new stand for the start of the 2018–19 season if the bond scheme is successful. Five weeks after the campaign started, the £500,000 target was met after investment from over 200 fans. A further £100,000 was raised in the following days, meaning a total of £600,000 would be invested in the new North Stand development. The North Terrace was demolished in January 2018, with the club's FA Cup tie against Reading on 6 January 2018 the last fixture the stand could be used by supporters.
