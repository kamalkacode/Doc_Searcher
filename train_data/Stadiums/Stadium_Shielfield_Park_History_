== History ==
There has been a ground at Shielfield Park, named after land owned by local butcher William Shiel Dods, since 1890. Berwick Rangers played at a number of other sites in Berwick, including a ground adjacent to the present site at Shielfield. Berwick Rangers first entered the Scottish Football League in 1951. After a successful run in the 1953–54 Scottish Cup, a stand was purchased from Bradford City and the team settled at Shielfield. The ground was opened with a game against Aston Villa. The record attendance at Shielfield Park is 13,365, for the Scottish Cup game against Glasgow Rangers on 28 January 1967, which Berwick won 1–0 in a famous cup upset.Due to financial problems, Berwick Rangers was forced to sell Shielfield Park to the local council in 1985, who leased it back to the club. Both stand roofs were dismantled in 1990 as a safety precaution. Berwick Rangers nearly went out of business in 1992 and the lease was sold to a greyhound company. The greyhound company initially locked Berwick Rangers out, forcing the club to groundshare with other Second Division clubs. The company eventually relented and allowed the club back in for part of each week. The club's supporters eventually bought the lease out in August 1995.
