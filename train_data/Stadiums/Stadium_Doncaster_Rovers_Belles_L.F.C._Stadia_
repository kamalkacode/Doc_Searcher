Since 2007 the home of Doncaster Rovers Belles has been the Keepmoat Stadium, although the majority of the team's matches prior to 2011 were played at the 500–capacity athletics track beside the stadium. In January 2007 the club's first match in the 15,000–capacity main stadium resulted in a 5–2 defeat to Leeds United, before a crowd of 1,797. Doncaster Rovers Belles now play all their home fixtures in the FA Women's Super League inside the main arena.When the English women's football setup was nationalised in 1991, the Belles became the first team to play their home games in a professional Football League ground at Belle Vue. However, they were often barred from doing so by Doncaster Rovers F.C. and had to find local non–League grounds in order to fulfil their fixtures.
In November 1997 long-serving secretary Alan Burton told The Times that after their spell at Belle Vue, the Belles had "left suddenly, under a bit of a cloud." At that stage there was no connection at all between the Belles and Doncaster Rovers. The women's club were annoyed that Rovers had kept postponing Belles matches at short notice, ostensibly in order to save the Belle Vue pitch. According to Burton this caused the Belles a substantial loss of fan support.For many years the team played at the Welfare Ground (53°32′04″N 1°03′24″W), home of Armthorpe Welfare F.C., and in 2002 were playing at Brodsworth Welfare Ground (53°33′46″N 1°11′17″W), home of Brodsworth Welfare F.C.. The 1999–00 season was spent playing at Hatfield Main F.C.'s Broadway ground.In 1999 the club announced proposals for a purpose-built stadium at Toll Bar. The following year Doncaster Council granted the club a lease of some land in the area. The £1.6 million project was intended for the FA's launch of a professional women's League in 2003.
