In early 2018, owner John Radford announced a business proposal to establish a six-floor hotel at the club's stadium, in part replacing the existing Quarry Lane end infrastructure, in conjunction with an international brand. No formal planning application had been submitted to Mansfield District Council at the time of discussions at the club's ground, but a later application was authorised by the council in July 2018.


=== Greyhound racing ===
Greyhound racing at Field Mill lasted three years from 1928 until 1931. During March 1928 plans to add a greyhound track around the football pitch were drawn up and by mid May the track was complete. The track was very basic but did run under the National Greyhound Racing Club (NGRC) rules of racing starting on 26 May 1928.In 1929 the NGRC banned the track after the management fall foul of the regulations that included the refusal to comply with the NGRC stewards. The greyhound racing continued as an independent (unaffiliated to a governing body) until 17 October 1931.


=== Rugby league ===
A new professional rugby league club, Mansfield Marksman, was set up in Mansfield in 1984, playing at Field Mill for their first two seasons. Declining attendances meant the arrangement wasn't financially viable, and the club relocated to North Street in Alfreton in 1986.
