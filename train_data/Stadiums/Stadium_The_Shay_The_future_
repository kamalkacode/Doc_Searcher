== The future ==
Although no plans for future redevelopment have been confirmed, there has been talk of a new west stand, replacing the current Skircoat Stand. The plan was to build a two-tier stand with shops that backed onto Skircoat Road, however nothing has been officially announced.
Within the original East Stand designs there were plans for hospitality and media facilities in the south-east corner of the stadium. This stand (which is adjoined to the East Stand and of the same height) has been in a partially constructed state since work halted on the East Stand in 2002. This corner was omitted from the 2008 redesign and subsequent completion of the East Stand. Although there are no finances in place nor the demand to finish this corner, if there is ever the need many would imagine that this corner would be completed first as there would be less planning/ construction issues, and would thus be a quick way of increasing capacity/facilities. Many may argue that the unfinished stand detracts from the overall look of the ground, but with both the football and rugby teams gaining small attendances relative to the capacity, the stand is not exactly high up on the agenda.
