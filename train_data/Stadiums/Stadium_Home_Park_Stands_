The Mayflower stand, known as the Grandstand, is currently closed for redevelopment. The other three stands are very similar in design and are linked together at the corners, having been built in 2001.
The Devonport End houses the more vocal of the club's supporters. The Lyndhurst Stand is the largest of the three stands, holding about 7,000 spectators, including the corners. The corner towards the East side of the ground is now the dedicated family corner. The Barn Park End is where the away supporters are housed. It holds about 3,000 spectators. The standard allocation given to visiting clubs had previously been 1,300, and this had been increased in the past whenever demand required it. although only 1,300 tickets were issued to away fans for the upcoming 2018-19 season. All three stands have good views and standard facilities for a football stadium, including concourses, merchandise stands and food and drink outlets. The pitch measures about 100 metres (109 yards) long by 66 metres (72 yards) wide, with a few metres of run-off space on each side. The ground also has two pitch covers, rain and frost, to protect the pitch against adverse winter weather.
