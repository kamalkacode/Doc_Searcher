== Structure and facilities ==

The ground consists of four stands. The Silk FM stand (traditionally known as the London Road or Main stand) runs along one side of the pitch. It is usually given over entirely to home supporters, unless the travelling support is particularly large, in which case the right-hand side of this stand houses some away fans. There is terracing along the entire length of the pitch, with a small stand at the back of the terracing. The Macclesfield Audi Stand (traditionally known as the Star Lane End) is to the left of the Silk FM stand, and is used by the home support. Opposite the Silk FM stand is the Henshaw's Stand (originally known as the McAlpine stand, named after the architects that also designed the ground of Huddersfield Town). This is all-seated and covered, and houses home supporters, and a small number of travelling fans. At the opposite end to the Macclesfield Audi Stand is the Silkmen Terrace, which is an open terrace and is given to away fans. Unfortunately, as Macclesfield is often struck by wet weather, this can make for an uncomfortable spectating experience for visiting fans. There are plans to introduce some seating at the back of the Silkmen End and build a leisure complex and hotel behind it, but currently the finances required to do this do not exist.
