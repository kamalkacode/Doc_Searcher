Capacity is currently 6,500 with 1,200 seats. Attendances for Stalybridge Celtic have been well short of capacity, with average crowds in the 2008–09 and 2009–10 seasons being around 500.Before the construction of their own ground, F.C. United of Manchester used the ground for some home games from 2009 whenever Gigg Lane was unavailable, usually when Bury were scheduled to play a home game on the same day. FC United generally exceeded Stalybridge's home attendances when they played at Bower Fold. Bower Fold was F.C. United's official home ground for the first half of the 2014–15 season.The record attendance at Bower Fold stands at 10,400, though unofficial estimates range from 12,000 to 13,500. This was achieved on 8 February 1921 when Dick Kerr Ladies beat a Rest of Lancashire XI 10–0. £600 was raised for the Ashton-under-Lyne Infirmary, which forms part of Tameside Hospital. Stalybridge Celtic's record attendance was achieved on 17 January 1923, against West Bromwich Albion. 9,753 spectators saw Stalybridge Celtic lose 2–0 in a F.A. Cup First Round Proper replay.
It was announced in December 2015 that Oldham RLFC would play their home games at Bower Fold from 2016 onward, as their previous home was seen as unfit to host Championship rugby competitions.
