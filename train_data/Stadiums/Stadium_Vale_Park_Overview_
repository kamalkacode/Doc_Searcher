== Overview ==
At 520 feet above sea level it is the eleventh highest ground in the country, and third highest in the English Football League. The pitch is clay underneath the grass, rather than sand. These two factors make the pitch vulnerable to freezing temperatures. There is also a coal seam under the pitch, and numerous mine shafts dotted around the local area, including many under the park opposite the ground.The Vale Park pitch is one of the widest in the Football League. The pitch was originally laid over a filled-in marl hole and does not have a subsoil structure so is liable to flooding as it lacks proper drainage; a complete re-laying of the pitch would be needed to fix the issue (the club were quoted Â£450,000 for this work in 2014). The head groundsman since September 1992 is Steve Speed. He was one of three groundsmen nominated for the League Two Groundsmen of the Year award in 2009. Denis Dawson was head groundsman from 1966 to 1975; he succeeded Len Parton and was followed by Graham Mainwaring.
