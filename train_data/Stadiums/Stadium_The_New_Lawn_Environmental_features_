Following the investment of new chairman and eco-tycoon Dale Vince, and his company Ecotricity, The New Lawn employs a number of eco-friendly features designed to help make the stadium one of the most environmentally sustainable football stadiums in the world. The playing surface features as the world's first organic football pitch, meanwhile solar panels on the roof of the stadium as well as outside will eventually provide enough electricity to power 25 per cent of the stadium.The pitch also collects rainwater to be recycled around the stadium and all waste cooking oil at the club is recycled into biofuel. The club introduced a solar powered 'MowBot' in April 2012 which cuts the grass on the pitch and uses GPS technology to automatically guide it round the pitch without the need for human intervention. It is the first solar powered robotic lawn mower to be used on a football pitch in British football.
Local farmers use the grass cuttings from the stadium to condition their soil plus the stadium is the first meat-free football stadium in the country after the club changed to an environmentally sustainable menu in February 2011. The area outside the stadium has also been developed into a habitat for wildlife through the planting of wild flowers and native trees.In December 2012, the club beat 200 other nominees to first prize in the Institute of Groundsmanship awards in the sustainability and environmental category for its organic pitch and the environmental aspects at The New Lawn.
