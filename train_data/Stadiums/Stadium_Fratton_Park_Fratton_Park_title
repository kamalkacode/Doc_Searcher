Fratton Park is a football stadium in the English city of Portsmouth in the United Kingdom. Fratton Park remains as the original home of Portsmouth F.C. since the founding of the football club in 1898.
Uniquely, Fratton Park is currently the only stadium in English professional football that is not on the mainland island of Great Britain, as it is built on Portsea Island, where the city of Portsmouth is located.
Fratton Park was built in 1899 on the site of a potato field in the former farming village of Milton, which later became a residential district of Portsmouth as the city expanded across Portsea Island during the twentieth century.  Fratton Park's name was influenced by its convenient closeness to Fratton railway station, one mile to the west of the stadium.
The stadium is affectionately known as "The Old Girl" by Portsmouth supporters.Fratton Park was publicly and officially opened on Tuesday 15 August 1899. The first ever football match at Fratton Park, on Wednesday 6 September 1899 was a 2-0 friendly win against Southampton FC, and was attended by 4,141 supporters.
