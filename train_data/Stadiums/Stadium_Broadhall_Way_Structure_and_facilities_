== Structure and facilities ==

The ground's pitch includes four stands – the East Terrace, the North Terrace, the West Stand and South Stand. The West Stand (also known as the Main Stand) is all-seated and covered, and covers the length of the pitch, although it has open corners to either side of the stand. At the back of the stand there are a number of glass-fronted areas to various club offices and executive boxes. The club shop and ticket office is situated next to the West Stand, opposite to the club's official car-park. Parts of the West Stand were refurbished after the 2011–12 season, with the club widening the car park behind the stand, as well as extending the entrance into the executive boxes in the stand. Opposite to the West Stand is the East Terrace, which is a covered terrace for home supporters. The terrace has a gable with a clock sitting on its roof above the half-way line, as well as holding a television gantry on its roof.North Terrace is situated behind the goal at the north end of the ground and is just seven steps deep. Three-quarters of the terrace is covered, whilst one-quarter is open and without cover. The stand can hold a capacity of 700 people, and also offers facilities for disabled fans. Opposite the North Terrace is the South Stand, which is a single tiered, all-seated covered stand. The stand was built in 2001, costing £600,000 and includes an executive suite underneath. The South Stand is reserved for away supporters and can hold a capacity of 1,400. From 2001 until 2011, the stand was known for sponsorships reasons as the Buildbase Stand. The stand also has an electronic scoreboard in the centre of the roof, making it visible to home supporters. The scoreboard was replaced in October 2011. Behind the stand is the supporters' club. A new set of floodlights were installed before the start of the club's 2007–08 campaign.
