== Temperament ==
Dogos are big-game hunters and are also trained for search and rescue, police assistance, service dogs, guide for the blind, competitive obedience, Schutzhund and military work.The Dogo Argentino because of its purpose, is very stubborn and pain tolerant. This combined with the breed's natural intelligence and domineering tendencies mean that this dog is not suitable for inactive or inexperienced homes, and is ideal for a working home, or at a minimum a very active home. The breed needs an experienced owner and firm leadership, and is not ideal as a pet or service dog role, though it has been successful in the latter.
The Dogo is an intelligent and courageous dog with a strong, natural instinct to protect its home and family. Dogos are very social dogs and are happiest when included in all family activities. Dogos make a strong distinction between familiar people and strangers, so it is imperative that they be well trained and socialized at an early age.
Dogos are hunters of great courage and endurance, and will work individually or in packs. They have also successfully been used in police protection work. An unsteady temperament is a serious fault. {UKC Breed Standard} The Dogo has a life expectancy of 10 to 12 years.


=== Health ===
As in the Dalmatian, white Boxer, and the white Bull Terrier, the dogo may experience pigment-related deafness. There is possibility of an approximate 10% deafness rate overall with some dogos afflicted uniaurally (one deaf ear) and some binaurally (deaf in both ears). Studies have shown that the incidence of deafness is drastically reduced when the only breeding stock used is that with bilaterally normal hearing.
