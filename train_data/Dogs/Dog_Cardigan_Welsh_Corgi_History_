== History ==
Pembrokes and Cardigans first appeared together in dog shows in 1925 when they were shown under the rules of The Kennel Club in Britain. The Corgi Club was founded in December, 1925 in Carmarthen in South Wales. It is reported that the local members favored the Pembroke breed, so a club for Cardigan enthusiasts was founded a year later (1926). Both groups have worked hard to ensure the appearance and type of breed are standardized through careful selective breeding. Pembrokes and Cardigans were officially recognized by the Kennel Club in 1928 and were lumped together under the heading Welsh Corgis. In 1934, the two breeds were recognized individually and shown separately.


=== Origins ===

Cardigans are said to originate from the Teckel family of dogs, which also produced Dachshunds.
They are claimed to be among the oldest of all herding breeds; believed to have been in existence in Wales since around the year 1200 B.C.


=== Name ===
The word "corgi" is derived from the Welsh: cor gi, which means "dwarf dog". The breed was formerly called "yard-long dog" (Welsh: ci-llathed). Today's name comes from their area of origin: Cardigan (Welsh 'Ceredigion').


=== Modern breed ===
Originally used only as a farm guardian, they eventually took on the traits of a cattle drover, herder, and many more. They are still highly valued for their herding, working, and guarding skills, as well as their companionship.
