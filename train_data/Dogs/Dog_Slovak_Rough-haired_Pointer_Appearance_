With a body type much like the three breeds from which its foundation stock was derived, the SRHP has an intelligent, alert expression and a "rough" or "broken" coat, with harsh, wiry hair and whiskers ("facial furnishings" or, informally, "moustaches") like those of the German Wirehaired Pointer or the Cesky Fousek.  The coat is of moderate length in any shade between a tweedy gray-brown and the classic pewter-silver coat of the Weimeraner. The eyes may range from the deep amber of the German Wirehaired Pointer to the light shades seen in the Weimaraner.
The FCI has developed a detailed standard which states the eyes of juveniles may be "azure" but those of adults must be amber.  White is permitted on the chest and feet.  Lighter and darker shades of gray are permitted throughout the coat, even to the point of speckling.  The FCI standard further requires a dark nose, eyelids, and pads of the feet; a scissors bite; and a moderately sloped stop of about 45°.  Per the FCI standard, the tail is docked at 50% of natural length, and the dewclaws are removed.  The back is straight, and the height at the withers ought to be from  62–68 cm (24–27 in) for males and from  57–64 cm (22–25 in)  for bitches.  The FCI standard also states that "the ratio of length of the body to the height at the withers must be of 10:9 in the males and of 10:8 in the females."
