== Description ==


=== Origin ===
The Brazilian Terrier is one of the two native breeds of Brazil. Jack Russell Terriers were brought to Brazil from Europe in the 1800s and served as the nearest ancestor of the Brazilian Terrier.
Breeds such as Miniature Pinschers and large Chihuahuas were also crossed with Jack Russell Terriers to develop this dog. It is said that this kind of breed is rarely found outside Brazil.


=== Appearance ===
This terrier stands between 13-16 in (35.5-40.5 cm) at the withers. Its coat is always tri-color (white, tan and black or white, tan and blue). A docked tail, narrow chest, flat triangular skull and a well balanced body are the most common characteristics. The ears are half-pricked and folded, with the
tip falling down.


=== Temperament ===

The temperament of this breed is very similar to a Jack Russell Terrier, very alert, perky and intelligent. Very friendly, loves to play and dig holes. Spirited and obedient but fearless, as watchdogs they will only bark to get your attention and then leave the rest up to you.
This breed needs a firm, consistent and confident pack leader, otherwise, they will become willful and determined. Their hunting instinct is the strongest among average terriers and should not be trusted with other small animals.


=== Living conditions, exercise, and grooming ===
Small apartments or spaces are not good for this type of dog, because they are very active, an average-size yard is highly recommended.
It also needs both physical and mental activities to be happy, a common tendency is for it to become destructive and restless if kept indoors, therefore long daily walks are the best option.
