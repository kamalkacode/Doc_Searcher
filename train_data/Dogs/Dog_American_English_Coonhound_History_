== History ==
The breed's ancestry can be traced back to Foxhounds brought to the United States by European settlers during the 17th and 18th centuries. It shares a common ancestry with all other coonhounds, with the exception of the Plott Hound. The breed developed from 'Virginia Hounds', which were developed over time from dogs imported to the United States by Robert Brooke, Thomas Walker and the first President of the United States, George Washington. The terrain here was much rougher than what they were used to, so the breed was specifically bred over time to better adapt to these new conditions. It was traditionally used to hunt raccoons by night and the American red fox by day. The United Kennel Club (UKC) first recognized it in 1905 as the English Fox and Coonhound.The Treeing Walker Coonhound was recognized separately by the UKC in 1945, separating it from the English Fox and Coonhound breed. The following year, the Bluetick Coonhound was also split into an entirely different breed.The English Coonhound was accepted into the American Kennel Club's Foundation Stock Service as the American English Coonhound in 1995. On 1 January, 2010, it was moved up to the Miscellaneous Class. Following the recognition of the breed by the AKC in the hound group on 30 June 2011 as the 171st breed, the American English Coonhound became eligible to compete in the National Dog Show in 2011, followed by its eligibility for the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show and the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship for the first time in 2012.
