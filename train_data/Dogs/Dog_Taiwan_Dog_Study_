Taiwan Dogs are originally native Taiwanese dogs, descendants of the South Asian hunting dogs called the "Pariah dog" which ancient local inhabitants used to live with in the central mountainous districts. This breed was the loyal companion of the ancient hunter in the wild forest. In 1980, a cooperative study was carried out by the National Taiwan University, Japanese Gifu University, and Ota Keming's(太田克明) research team from Nagoya University. Scholars targeted native Taiwan dogs as their subject, by visiting twenty-nine tribes of local inhabitants. As a result, it was confirmed that the present Taiwan Dog is a descendant of the South Asian hunting dogs. This project was originally Ota Keming's idea, as he was tracing the origin of Japanese indigenous dog, so he sought Sung Yung-yi's help in completing his research project.
Of the 46 purebloods that Sung Yung-yi found during 1976-1980, blood tests showed that they were related to dogs found in Southern Japan and that they were descendants of the South Asian Hunting Dog. Little known outside of Taiwan, Formosans are recognized with a pedigree from the Taiwan Kennel Club and the International Canine Organization.
