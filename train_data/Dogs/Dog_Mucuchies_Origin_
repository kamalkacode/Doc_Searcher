== Origin ==
Mucuchies are believed to descend from dogs introduced by Spanish conquerors at the end of the 16th century as watchdogs and herders. It is possibly a descendant of the Spanish Mastiff, the Pyrenean Mastiff, Algerian Mastiff, the Atlas Shepherd Dog or Aidi, and the Great Pyrenees. Over the years these dog breeds mixed, ultimately creating a powerful and versatile working dog. Others suggest that Mucuchies were deliberately bred by veterinarian Dr. Wilender Ferrari.
Its importance in Venezuelan history came after Simón Bolívar reached the town of Mucuchíes in Venezuelan Andes of Mérida state during his struggle for Venezuelan independence and subsequently adopted a dog of this breed.
During 1926-27 Mucuchies were found throughout Venezuela. After the wide distribution of the breed, its purity and quality was in serious decline in the early part of the 20th century. In 1961 a club was created to preserve the breed, and by 1964 it was declared the Venezuelan "National Dog". The club then appears to have disbanded, which would mean an uncertain future for the breed.
In 2008, in order to preserve the national breed, MINTUR (el Ministerio del Poder Popular para el Turismo), led at the time by Titina Azuaje, approved the creation of the Fundación Nevado (Funev), with six of these dogs transferred to the Waraira Repano Cable Car System in El Ávila National Park, where similar environmental conditions to the Andes exist. The success of this effort led President Hugo Chávez to encourage and amplify this program.
