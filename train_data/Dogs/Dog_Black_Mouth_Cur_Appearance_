Black Mouth Curs have short coats, either coarse or fine, and a combination of the two types may appear in the same litter. 
Black Mouth Curs come in many colors. All shades of red, yellow and fawn; black; brown; buckskin; or brindle; with or without black muzzle or mask. Very small amounts of white are allowed under the chin, around the nose, on the neck, chest, legs, and tip of tail, provided that no more than ten percent total of the dog's body may be white. Dilute coat colors are acceptable and may be identified by the following traits: green, yellow, or light brown eyes; white toenails; red or yellow coat without any trace of black hair. Never spotted, mottled, merle, or with white collar. A disqualification is albinism.The muzzle is square-shaped. It may have a melanistic mask, which is most often black. Maskless dogs are allowed but not preferred. The name 'Black Mouth' refers to the dark pigmentation around the lips that also extends into the interior of the mouth including the roof of the mouth, gums, and cheeks, excluding the tongue. The ears are medium-sized and hanging and may either be melanistic like the muzzle or the same color as the coat.
The tail of a Black Mouth Cur can be of any length; long, medium, bob tailed, or none at all. Some owners of curs that are born with a tail will dock their dog's tail, and some cur dogs are born with little or no tail at all. The feet are of moderate size, compact and well arched. Pads are large, tough, and well cushioned. Toes may be webbed. Single or double dewclaws may be present.The adult weight ranges depending on the line from 35 pounds minimum for tree dogs (i.e. Ladner BMCs) to 50 pounds and over 100 pounds for herding or hog dogs (i.e. the Weatherford Ben line). Their height can also vary with a minimum height of 16 inches tall. Males in the same lines are normally larger than females.
