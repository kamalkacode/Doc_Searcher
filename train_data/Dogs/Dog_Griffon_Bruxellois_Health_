== Health ==

Griffons have relatively few inherited health problems, but should still be tested for congenital defects, the most serious of which are Syringomyelia (SM) and Chiari-like malformation (CM). The typical life span of a Griffon is somewhere in the range of 10 to 15 years.


=== Birthing ===

Griffons usually have no trouble whelping on their own, but sometimes complications can necessitate a Caesarean section.  The size of a litter is typically 1-3 puppies.  The size of the litter often determines the extent of these complications. Litters of six are not unheard of.  When they are born, the puppies only weigh a few ounces (about 100 grams) and are small enough to fit in the palm of an adult's hand. They can get leg and heart problems from an early age.


=== Cleft palate ===
One issue that is typically fatal for the puppies is having a cleft palate.  It results in the puppy not receiving nourishment from the mother and eventually starvation.  It is uncommon but, depending on the size of the cleft, it is possible for the puppy to survive whereas it becomes older surgery can be done to close the hole.


=== Eyes ===
Most have large eyes that may require rechecks from a veterinarian.

Lacerations - Lacerations are a common issue amongst the breed.  Because the Griffons have such large eyes and a short snout, there is very little there to protect their vision from foreign bodies.  If a laceration is left untreated it can result in blindness.
Cataracts - As with most breeds, cataracts are a common problem as the dog ages.  For many breeders it is a disappointment that the cataracts typically develop long after the dog has already been bred.
Lens Luxations - Lens luxations can be fairly common in the breed and result in secondary glaucoma
Glaucoma - Glaucoma can also be a common issue amongst Griffons owing to the breed's facial features and eye size.


=== Heat Stroke ===
Although Griffons have a shortened snout, heat stroke is not a major concern for them as it is with other flat-faced breeds.  The breed's shortened muzzle may cause respiratory problems in extreme heat, but overall they tolerate both hot and cold weather well.  As with any breed, owners must use common sense and not leave them outdoors without protection from the elements or subject them to rigorous exercise during extreme temperatures, so let them in your house for cool air and some water.


=== Syringomyelia ===
Syringomyelia (SM) is a condition affecting the brain and spine, causing symptoms ranging from mild discomfort to severe pain and partial paralysis. Syringomyelia is characterised by fluid filled cavities within the spinal cord. SM occurs secondary to obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) especially if that obstruction is at the foramen magnum. To date the condition has been also reported in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, King Charles Spaniels, Yorkshire Terriers, Maltese Terriers, Chihuahuas, Miniature Dachshunds, Miniature/Toy Poodles, Bichon Fris√©, Pugs, Shih Tzus, Pomeranians, Boston Terriers, French Bulldogs, a Pekingese, a Miniature Pinscher, mixbreeds, and a couple of cats.
Not all dogs with SM have clinical signs. The presence of signs is correlated to the width of the syrinx and extent of spinal cord dorsal horn damage. Syrinxes can progressively expand and a dog which is asymptomatic in early life may eventually experience pain.
