== History and use ==
The Grand Anglo-Francais Tricolore is descended from crosses between tricoloured Poitevins and Foxhounds. This combination has strongly influenced this breed in many ways. These animals are strong and compact in stature like the foxhound with a black blanketed tri-colour coat. They were used as a pack dog to hunt large game such as red deer, wild boar and roe deer or smaller animals such as fox. "Grand" does not necessarily refer to size, "in most cases it is simply a label for a pack that is used for larger game".The breed is recognised in its country of origin by the Société Centrale Canine (French Kennel Club) and internationally in 1983 by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in Group 6, Scenthounds. In France it is bred and kept primarily as a hunting dog, not as a pet or showdog. The breed has been exported to North America, where it is recognised by the United Kennel Club in its Scenthound Group. It is also registered by numerous minor registries and internet dog registry businesses, and is promoted as a rare breed for those seeking a unique pet.
