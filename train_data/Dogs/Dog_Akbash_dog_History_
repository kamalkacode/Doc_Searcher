== History ==
This breed was introduced to North America in the 1970s by Americans Judith and David Nelson  who had been conducting research on white coloured dogs in the historical Armenian highlands.
Archeological evidence suggests that the earliest civilizations arose in this region of the world where plants were first cultivated and the first livestock were domesticated. In short order there would have been a need for livestock protection dogs to care for the livestock.
Other white breeds of livestock protection dogs from around the world include, but may not be limited to: 

Aidi or Chien De L'Atlas, originally from North Africa (preferred color white, but other colors appear)
Great Pyrenees, of the Pyrenees Mountain areas in France and Spain (may have coloured patches, especially around the head)
Greek Sheepdog, from Greece
Komondor from Hungary
Kuvasz from Hungary (white or ivory)
Maremma-Abruzzese Sheepdog, from the Maremma plains and from the Abruzzi mountainous region of Italy (may have light yellow/orange on ears)
Polish Tatra Sheepdog or Owczarek Podhalanski, from Poland
Ciobănesc Românesc de Bucovina, also known as Southeastern European Shepherd Dog in the FCI,  from Romania
Slovak Cuvac or Slovensky Tchouvatch, from Slovakia
