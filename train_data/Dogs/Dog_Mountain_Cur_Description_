== Description ==


=== Appearance ===
Mountain Curs are short-coated dogs which come in blue, yellow, brown, or brindle coloration. Some individuals will also show white markings on the face or chest, but some don't have the white markings. The weight is usually between 30 and 60 pounds, and height is 18-26 inches for males and 16-24 inches for females.


=== Temperament ===
The Mountain Cur is intelligent, easily trained, and neither vicious nor shy. They are known to always try to please their masters. They are not, however, dogs to be trifled with; historically many a cur died fighting to protect their family from attackers or dangerous predators.
These curs were bred to work, and if deprived of the opportunity to hunt, guard, or work around a farm they will grow anxious and bored. When they have a job to do, these dogs are generally happy and obedient, and are able to get along well with children and other pets.


=== Health ===
Mountain Curs can live up to 14â€“16 years, and there are no reported breed-specific health issues.
