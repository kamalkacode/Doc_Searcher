== Description ==
The "miniature shar-pei"  is not classified by any Kennel Club as a separate breed.   The mini shar-pei has been bred from a recessive gene of the shar-pei, i.e.,  the runt of the litter bred from the run of the litter,  to create a smaller specimen.


=== Appearance ===
The appearance and shape of the breed can be described as broad and square in proportion to height and body length.  Their physical attributes are much the same as their larger brethren having a large head, wide padded muzzle, highly set ears, blue black tongue, with wrinkled head, neck and shoulders.


==== Size ====
The height of a Miniature Shar Pei does not exceed 17 inches high at the withers; over 17 inches is a disqualification and does not meet the breed standard.  In terms of weight, they range from 25 to 45lbs.


==== Coat ====
The coat can be classified as one of three types. "Horse Coat" being not more than one quarter inch in length with a harsh feel, "Brush Coat" less than one inch in length with a velvety feel, or "Bear Coat" being longer than one inch in length with a wavy smooth feel.  Shedding in this breed is minimal and occurs through a process called "blowing coat".  This usually happens in the spring and fall over a short period of a few days.


==== Color ====

Coloring can be any variety of White (very rare), Fawn, Cream, Chocolate, Apricot, Red, Lilac, Blue, or Black in Solid, Sable or Dilute variations; Dilute being a dog whose nose, nails, pads, anus and coat do not contain any black pigment.


=== Temperament ===
The Miniature Shar Pei is affectionate, adaptable, playful, confident, calm, independent, regal, and alert.  They are inherently clean and quiet.   Some can be a bit aloof and though they are wise, obedience training requires a confident, consistent authority figure to prevent them from becoming overly dominant.  This breed makes a delightful companion but is very independent with a temperament that will depend highly on how the owner treats the dog.  It is a dog that bonds well with its family and is very devoted.  Daily walks are needed to give the dog some exercise.  During times of increased temperature walks should be shortened as these dogs are somewhat sensitive to the heat.


=== Health ===

Many of this breeds health issues depend upon the lines that the dog comes from.  Dogs with few hereditary issues will tend to be healthier than ones whose parents or grand parents had problems.  One misconception about the health of the Miniature Shar Pei is that its wrinkles lead to skin problems. A healthy dog's wrinkles should not require any special care. The wrinkles can cause other issues, occasionally puppies have so many wrinkles that the excess skin covers the dogs eyes and puts pressure on the eyelids causing them to rub on the cornea.  This symptom is called entropion and can usually be corrected through a process called "tacking" where by using stitches to temporarily hold the wrinkles away from the eyes, the puppy is given time to grow into its skin.  In severe cases where tacking is unsuccessful, an operation may be needed to surgically remove the excess skin around the dogs eyes.  Like the larger Standard Shar Pei, Swollen Hocks Syndrome is sometimes seen in this breed and if not treated can lead to Amyloidosis resulting in Kidney Failure.  Other than these few issues the breed tends to be relatively healthy requiring only routine visits to the vet.
