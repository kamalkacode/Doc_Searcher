== Temperament ==
The Greek Harehound has a lively, confident and outgoing temperament. These dogs are skilled, fearless hunters, and have a keen sense of smell as well as excellent strength and stamina. Their activity level is high and require regular physical stimulation and a large space to exercise. The Greek Harehound is also devoted to its owner, and generally makes a fine family pet, although they are better with older children. Since the Greek Harehound was originally bred to hunt in packs, it is placid with other dogs, yet they may be wary and suspicious around strangers.
Like other scent hound breeds, the Greek Harehound is independent and strong-willed at times. Males in particular require a confident owner to be in charge. These dogs can also be stubborn and impatient at times, so they should be trained at an early age. Positive reinforcements and proper discipline is necessary when training a Greek Harehound and rough handling should be avoided. Due to their original hunting purposes, the Greek Harehound is vocal and extremely loud, and may enjoy chasing small animals and moving things. They may also show destructiveness when bored or left alone for a prolonged period of time.
Overall speaking, these dogs can be challenging to train and are not recommended for the inexperienced dog owner as well as apartment life. They are more suitable as hunting dogs than house pets.
