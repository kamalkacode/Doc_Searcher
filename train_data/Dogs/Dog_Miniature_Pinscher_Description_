=== Appearance ===
The Miniature Pinscher is structurally a well balanced, sturdy, compact, short-coupled, smooth-coated dog. They are naturally well groomed, vigorous and alert. Characteristic traits are their hackney-like action, fearless animation, complete self-possession, and spirited presence. Legs should be straight with no bending in or out. The Miniature Pinscher frequently has a docked tail and cropped ears, though the AKC no longer requires ear cropping for shows.


==== Size ====
According to the American Kennel Club, the Miniature Pinscher should be 10–12 1⁄2 inches (25–32 cm) high with most desirable height 11–11 1⁄2 inches (28–29 cm) at the highest point of the shoulder blades. Length is equal to height, though females may be slightly longer. The ideal weight is 8–10 pounds (3.6–4.5 kg).


==== Coat and color ====

The coat is short and smooth, with no undercoat. Available colors include solid red, stag red, blue stag red, chocolate stag red, fawn stag red, as well as black, chocolate, blue, and fawn with tan points or rust points. For showing in the United States, AKC disqualifies all colors but the solid or stag red and the black or chocolate with rust points. The Pinscher-Schnauzer Club, which maintains the standard for showing in Germany, has the same restrictions. In the UK, blue with rust points is allowed in the show ring. White spots larger than half an inch or black spots on the points are disqualifications for showing in most countries. Merle is not an accepted coloring of the breed.


=== Care ===
Grooming is easy, as the smooth, short-haired coat requires little attention, needing only occasional brushing and shampooing. Care must be taken in cold weather.  Sweaters or baby blankets can help keep a Miniature Pinscher keep from getting too cold. Miniature Pinschers are an active breed and need access to a fenced yard, or be given a daily walk.


=== Temperament ===
Miniature Pinschers  are for experienced dog owners. Many people underestimate the care, time, and effort needed in order to raise a Miniature Pinscher. The Miniature Pinscher is an assertive, outgoing, active, and independent breed. Miniature pinschers are energetic and need a fenced yard to run in; they make great agility dogs. They are great escape artists and some recommend having a kennel with a lid on it for them to run around in.
