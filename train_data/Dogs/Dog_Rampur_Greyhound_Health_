Rampurs are typically a healthy and long-lived breed, living up to fifteen years, and hereditary illness is rare. What diseases are seen are usually similar to those seen in other greyhound breeds; Rampurs have been known to develop esophageal achalasia, gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat), and osteosarcoma Because the Rampur's lean physique makes it ill-suited to sleeping on hard surfaces, owners should generally provide soft bedding; without bedding, Rampurs are prone to develop painful skin sores, though feeding them foods high in vitamin A may also help mitigate this.
Due to Rampurs' unusual physiology and anatomy, a veterinarian with experience in the peculiarities of the breed is advisable, particularly when anaesthesia is required. If such specialists are not available, it is best to seek one who specialises in the treatment of greyhounds or related breeds.
Greyhounds demonstrate unusual blood chemistry, which can be misread by veterinarians not familiar with the breed; this can result in an incorrect diagnosis. Rampurs have higher levels of red blood cells than do other breeds, (a trait inherited from their English Greyhound ancestors). Since red blood cells carry oxygen to the muscles, this higher level allows the hound to move larger quantities of oxygen faster from the lungs to the muscles. Veterinary blood services should use greyhounds as  blood donors if there are no available Rampurs, (Greyhounds are generally used as universal blood donors anyway).
