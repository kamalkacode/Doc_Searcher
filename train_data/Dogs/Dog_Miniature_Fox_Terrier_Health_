Miniature Fox Terriers are generally healthy and hardy despite their size.  They need little maintenance; some individuals that do not run often on hard surfaces will need regular nail clipping. Luxating patellae, a common ailment among small breeds, occurs frequently among backyard bred dogs, bred by people who are not registered breeders; the Mini Foxie Club rules state that, before breeding occurs, a health declaration must be obtained from a veterinarian and that the dog must be classified and graded by the club.  This rule has greatly helped to reduce the incidence of luxating patellae in the breed.  Meals should always be small and nutritious; this is a small breed, with a small sized stomach. To avoid or minimise painful ailments such as arthritis, dogs need to be kept trim and athletic.


=== Longevity ===
Miniature Fox Terriers are renowned for their good health and longevity, often reaching an advanced age. With good care and a happy life, Miniature Fox Terriers can live as long as 18 to 20 years, and sometimes beyond. Factors influencing longevity include a healthy diet, a sense of belonging, sufficient exercise, room to run around and generally how happy the dog is.
