Most people compare the Alaskan Klee Kai to the popular Siberian Husky due to their similar fur markings. While they are both Spitz breed dogs, the Alaskan Klee Kai is significantly smaller in size. They are also behaviorally almost utmost opposites to their large husky counterparts; they tend to be shy, skittish and wary around strangers.  The Alaskan Klee Kai is a highly intelligent, playful, curious and high energy breed. They can be standoffish and cautious, and sometimes defensive around unfamiliar individuals. Because of their inherently reserved disposition in the presence of strangers, continual socialization throughout an Alaskan Klee Kai's life is highly encouraged. They are moderately active and have a strong prey drive, keeping them on a leash is necessary as they will pursue any distraction that comes their way. This means unless they are properly introduced and raised with smaller animals such as rabbits, hamsters, cats, and birds, they will hunt them.
They can be a great family dog if raised with young children who are careful with animals: Alaskan Klee Kais are not likely to tolerate being mistreated and should be monitored when with children. Because of their intelligence, they do well in obedience classes and have a high drive to please their owners which helps them to excel in this area as well as many other types of activities. Another such activity is agility in which the Alaskan Klee Kai almost seems to have been bred to take part. However, a lack of stimulation tends to lead these dogs to be mischievous or even destructive, but this can be avoided through regular exercise.
The Alaskan Klee Kai are generally quiet dogs and are not known to be problem barkers, but it is common for Klee Kai to create vocalizations and to "talk" similar to other northern breeds.
