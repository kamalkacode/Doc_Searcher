=== Appearance ===
According to the breed standard, the Shiloh Shepherd should have a regal bearing that shows intelligence and strength. The balance between elegance and strength is the key to their distinct appearance and fluid movement. Their larger size should not impede their movement or grace.
The head should be broad and slightly domed with a gradually tapering muzzle; bite alignment is important since either an over or undershot bite is a disqualifying fault.  Muzzles and lips should be black; though pink has been seen, it is a fault.  Ears should be firm, triangular and well cupped; they are carried erect when at attention. Their eyes are always a shade of dark to light brown; no other eye colors are bred.
Their broad and muscular backs should be straight with a gradual slope from the withers that complements their full chest.  Tails should be long, plush and slightly curved; they may show a more pronounced curve when the dog is excited or exercising but should never be a ring or a hook shape.


==== Size standards ====
The Shiloh Shepherd is powerfully built and well-balanced and should have a proud carriage and smooth, effortless gait. The male Shiloh stands 30 inches (76 cm) or more in height with a minimum of 28 inches (71 cm); he weighs 120 to 140 pounds (54–65 kg) with a minimum of 110 pounds (50 kg). The female is smaller, standing 28 inches (71 cm) or more in height with a minimum of 26 inches (66 cm) and weighing 100 to 120 pounds (45–54 kg) with a minimum of 80 pounds (36 kg). With their even proportions, Shilohs should appear longer than they are tall. They are bigger than German Shepherd Dogs.


==== Coat types ====
Shilohs come in two distinct coat varieties: the smooth or double coat and the plush coat. The smooth coat should be of medium length and lie close to the body; the hair at the neck and on the back of the fore and hind legs may be longer and thicker than other areas.  The outer coat will be dense, straight, and harsh. The plush coat is longer, with a soft undercoat and a distinctive "mane" which extends to the chest.  The body coat should not be over 5 inches (12.5 cm) long but will have feathering inside the ears and behind the legs which should not be over 3 inches (7.5 cm) long.
The smooth coat is easier to groom, though the plush coat may shed less. For show purposes, the tufts that grow between the toes and pads must be trimmed.  Coats that are open, wooly or curly are serious faults.


==== Coat colors ====
Shilohs come in a wide range of coat colors.  They may be bi or dual colored in black with tan, golden tan, reddish tan, silver, or sable.  They can also be solid golden, silver, red, dark brown, dark grey, or black sable. Solid black and solid white are possible, but for show purposes, the nose, lips, and eye rims must be solid black.  Blue and liver colors are possible but not bred for since they are disqualifying faults.Shilohs may have a small white blaze on the chest or white on the toes, but white in any other area is a fault.  To meet the standard, this should blend in with the lighter color of their coat.  Pale, washed-out colours are discouraged.


==== Movement and gait ====
The Shiloh's gait is smooth and rhythmic.  Their long strides and flowing motion require good muscular development and shows in its prime when the dog reaches maturity. Even while in a flying trot, the straightness of their back should be maintained.  The full trot is steady and level, without swaying or rolling.  To help keep their balance, their feet are brought in toward their middle line when running. Forward reach of the dog should be as long as possible, ideally extending past the nose, giving the Shiloh the impression of "flying". Faults in movement or carriage are serious.


=== Temperament ===
Bred as companions, Shilohs have loyal and outgoing personalities.  Many of the breeders in the United States operate out of large farms where the puppies are introduced to a large variety of animals. They were developed to be gentle and loving, able to work with animals and children, while still possessing a trainable drive for working applications, such as assistive service, obedience, or herding.   Shiloh Shepherds are reported to be the least territorial when compared to other Shepherd breeds. With proper socialization they adapt easily to a variety of environments and are stable.  Extreme aggression or shyness is severely penalized in the breed standard.
