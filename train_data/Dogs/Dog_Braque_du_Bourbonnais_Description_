Rounded in every direction, with lateral sides rounded, with parietal bones and zygomatic arches well developed. The axes of the skull and muzzle are parallel, or slightly divergent towards the front.


==== Coat ====
Two coat colors exist in the Bourbonnais, each of them having specific name because the color is specific to the breed:
-Liver, also called « wine dregs » or « faded lilac ».
-Fawn, also called « peach blossom ».
Big spots are tolerated on the body if they are not bigger than the palm of a hand. On the head, the two eyes must not be inside the same spot.

		
		
		


==== Differences sire/Female ====
The females are generally thinner, more elegant and longer than the sires (see pictures above).


==== Short tail ====
In the past called "short-tail pointer", the braque du Bourbonnais is sometimes born with a short tail (brachyury) or no tail at all (anury).
The gene responsible for this characteristic has been identified as being the same as the Brittany Spaniel one, of autosomal dominant type.


==== Head position ====
High or prolonging the shoulder.


=== Temperament ===
They have  a good temper and can be a good agreement dog. But it is mostly a hunter. It is a continental dog, and must be judged as such.


==== Allure and style ====
They show a lot of activity, even if he does not go very far. Their natural pace is gallop, but under cover he can use trot. They can change direction quickly, like polo. 


=== Pointing ===
They must point with authority, in a classical position.
