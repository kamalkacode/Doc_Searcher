== History ==
The ancestral type of the Wetterhoun was developed at least 400 years ago in the Dutch province of Fryslan. The origins of the Wetterhoun are conjectured to be from Gypsy dogs, crossed with an indigenous Frisian dog, perhaps the Old Water Dog, a type  which is now extinct. Dogs of this type were kept for the difficult and dangerous hunting of fitch (Mustela putorius) and otter (Lutra lutra) in the water. The dogs were also used for retrieving waterfowl and as watch dogs. Although the dogs almost disappeared during World War II, fanciers were able to bring the breed back through careful breeding, and it is gaining in popularity.

Databases are maintained by the Nederlandse Vereniging voor Stabij- en Wetterhounen (Club for the Stabij and Wetterhoun) and De Wetterhoun Vereniging Nederland for understanding pedigrees and computing inbreeding coefficients.
Internationally the breed is recognised by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in the Water Dogs section of Group 8. The United Kennel Club recognises the breed in its Gundog Group. The breed is also recognized by a number of minor registries, hunting clubs, and internet-based dog registry businesses and promoted as a rare breed for those seeking an unusual pet.
