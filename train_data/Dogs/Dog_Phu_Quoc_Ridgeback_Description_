=== Appearance ===
According to elders on Phú Quốc Island, the dog was traditionally four main colours: spotted, black, yellow, and striped; however now the colours have become more varied. The rarest and most highly prized colours are pure black and yellow, with black eyes, black toes and a black spotted tongue. A mature dog is about 20–25 kg, with a small head, long neck, quite a long snout, thin yet long ears and dark speckles on the tongue. The body of tapering belly, straight legs and webbed feet allow Phu Quoc dogs to swim and run exceedingly well. They are also very good at climbing and can climb trees.

An important sign to recognize a true Phu Quoc dog is the sword shaped ridge on its back, together with short, thin hair. When facing competitors or running after prey, the hair on their back becomes erect, creating a ridge making the dog look brave and strong. Now, it is difficult to find purebred Phu Quoc dogs, as they have mixed with other breeds.


=== Temperament ===
The Phu Quoc Ridgeback is best known for its ability to jump higher and run and swim faster than most other breeds. These dogs love to hunt and chase, and are also known for protecting their home. This breed is extremely loyal, loving, and naturally obedient, thriving on dependable human relationships. The Phu Quoc is an intelligent and curious breed that loves to learn.
