== Breed Characteristics ==


=== Body Structure ===
The Miniature American Shepherd is a small dog, with the breed standard specifying a height of 14-18 inches (36-46cm) for males and 13-17 inches (33-43cm) for females. Body structure suggests strength, but not bulkiness, with a clean-cut head and neck proportional to the body. The topline is level from withers to hip joint. The tail may be a natural bobtail, or may be docked to a length not exceeding three inches.


=== Coat ===
The coat is of medium length and may be straight or wavy, with moderate feathering present on the backs of the legs. Both sexes have a moderate mane and frill, though it is generally more pronounced in dogs than in bitches. The undercoat varies according to the climate in which the dog dwells.
Recognized coat colors in the breed are black, blue merle, red merle, and red (liver). There are no specified quantities of marbling, flecking, or blotching for merle coats. Tan markings are permissible anywhere around the eyes and face, as well as on the feet, legs, chest, muzzle, underside of the neck and body, under the tail, and on the undersides of the ears. White markings are permissible, but limited to the muzzle, cheeks, crown of the head, in a blaze on the head, in a partial or full collar on the neck, and on the belly, chest, front legs, and hind legs to the hock. White markings should not cover more than 25% of the ear, and white body markings outside of the above permitted areas may disqualify the dog from competition.


=== Temperament ===
The Miniature American Shepherd is described as an intelligent working breed with strong instincts for herding and flock guarding. It is easy to train, enthusiastic and persistent toward its work, and is protective, devoted, and loyal to its family. The Miniature American Shepherd is neither shy nor aggressive; any aggressive behavior is a disqualifying characteristic per the AKC.
