== Breed recognition ==
The Canaan dog was first recognized by the Israel Kennel Club in 1953 and by the FCI (Federation Cynologique Internationale) in 1966. The first accepted standard was written by Dr. Menzel.
In 1986, the first Canaan dogs were brought to Finland from Sha'ar Hagai Kennel, in Israel.
The Canaan Dog is today recognized by all the world's kennel clubs and is being bred in many countries.  There are breed clubs in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Finland, Germany, Israel and France.


=== Canada ===
The first Canaan dog came to Canada May 16, 1970.  The dogs came from a kennel in Delaware.
The Canadian Canaan Club was formed in 1972, and the first executive of the Club was elected on March 15, 1973. The club has since been dissolved.
The Canaan dog obtained entry into the Miscellaneous Class of the Canadian Kennel Club on December 1, 1975. In January 1993, the breed was accepted in the Working Group, as the Canadian Kennel Club did not have a Herding group at that time.


=== United Kingdom ===
The first Canaan Dog was brought to the UK from Lebanon in 1965, before they were a recognized breed.
In December 1970, they were recognized by the Kennel Club, and the breed was placed in the Utility Group.
In May 1992 the inaugural meeting of the Canaan Dog Club of the United Kingdom took place. Since 1996 the breed has begun to grow in numbers in the UK, though it is still quite numerically small.


=== United States ===
On September 7, 1965, Menzel sent four dogs to Ursula Berkowitz of Oxnard, California, the first Canaan dogs in the United States. The Canaan Dog Club of America was formed the same year, and stud book records were kept from these first reports. In June 1989, the Canaan dog entered the American Kennel Club (AKC) Miscellaneous Class. Its profile was raised when John F. Kennedy Jr. purchased a Canaan dog in the 1990s. Canaan dogs were registered in the AKC Stud Book as of June 1, 1997. The dogs began competing in conformation on August 12, 1997.
