== Appearance ==

Important proportions: The length of the body measures the same as the height at withers + X%

in male dogs X = 4–10%
in females X = 6–15%
the height at the elbow = 52–55% of the height at withers
the length of the muzzle = 43–45% of the length of the headBehaviour / temperament: proud, domineering, wary to strangers, brave and intelligent dog of tough, steady and independent character. It has a typical deep solid bark.


=== Head ===
Cranial region: The skull is broad and massive; the upper profile is slightly rounded with a shallow furrow on the forehead; the occipital bone is slightly pronounced. The supercilliary arches are only slightly developed. The axes of the muzzle and the cranial region are parallel.
Stop: Visible but not emphasized.


==== Facial region ====
Muzzle: Massive, widening at the base, shorter than the cranial part of the skull. Tapering very gradually from its set to the nose leather, ending flat.
Nose leather: Large and well-pigmented. Wide nostrils.
Lips: Thick and close-fitting. The upper lip covers the lower. Well-pigmented.
Jaws (teeth): Strong jaws. 42 teeth – 20 in the upper jaw and 22 in the lower jaw. Large and white teeth, well adapted to each other. Scissor bite or pincer bite.
Eyes: Small, deep and obliquely placed in the skull, with the lateral angles higher than the medial ones. Dark or hazel depending on the colour of the coat. The rim of the eyelid is dark pigmented. Expression is grim, confident, intelligent and firm.
Ears: Rather small, low set, V-shaped, pendant, close-fitting to the skull.
Neck: Short and powerful. Well-connected with the body and head. Angled at approximately 30o to the upper line. No pendant folds apart from a slight dewlap along the ventral part of the neck.


=== Body ===
Upper line: Horizontal, straight.
Withers: Well-pronounced, long and muscular.
Back: Straight, broad and well-muscled.
Loins: Medium length, broad, well-muscled. Pronounced above the upper line.
Croup: Medium length, broad and slightly sloping. Rounded and muscular.
Chest: Deep and broad but not barrel-shaped. Reaching deep at least to the points of elbow.
Under line and belly: The belly is muscular, taut and slightly tucked up.


=== Tail ===
Not very high set. It reaches to the hock joints but can also be short by birth. The coat on tail is long and rough. In repose it hangs low or the tip is curved. In movement or when the dog is alert, it is carried over the back in sabre form or curled.


=== Limbs ===
Forequarters: Straight, parallel, massive.
Shoulders and upper arm: Long and broad. Tightly joined to the body, well-muscled. Angle between shoulder blade and shoulder bone is approximately 105°.
Elbow: Close-fitting to chest.
Forearm: Long, bone-sturdy.
Carpus: Strong and broad.
Pastern: Slightly sloping. Broad and strong.
Front feet: Large, round, with taut, compact toes. Arched and hairy. Elastic dark pads. Toenails are thick and strong, preferably dark-coloured.
Hindquarters: Parallel, powerful, with moderate angulation.
Thigh: Medium length, broad, well-muscled.
Lower thigh: Long, broad and muscular.
Hock: Broad and taut. The tibial-tarsus angle is about 140°.


=== Gait/movement ===
Long reaching. Preferred movement is the springy trot.


=== Skin ===
Thick, elastic and closely fitting. No flabs apart from a slight dewlap along the lower (ventral) part of the neck. The nose leather and the visible mucus membranes should be black-pigmented and for red-white dogs should be brown.


=== Coat ===
Quality of hair: In hair length there are two types:

longhaired – length of coat on the body should measure over 12 cm.
shorthaired – length of coat on the body, neck and limbs measures up to 12 cm.Over the neck, withers, croup, at the back of legs, and on the tail the hair is long and rough. The topcoat is straight and stiff. Over the head and the front part of the legs the hair is short and close-fitting. Heavy undercoat.
Colour of hair: Two or tricolour, with spots. Most desired are clearly defined dark spots on white or big white spots on dark.


=== Height at the withers ===
Males: 63–75 cm.
Females: 60–69 cm.


=== Weight ===
Males: 40–55 kg
Females: 30–45 kg


=== Faults ===
Any departure from the foregoing points should be considered a fault and the seriousness with which the fault should be regarded should be in exact proportion to its degree.

head insufficiently massive and broad
pointed muzzle
stop insufficiently pronounced or too prominent
occipital bone too protruded
eyes protruded or round
ears set high or not close-fitting to the head
lack of pigmentation
neck long or too short
prominent dewlap on the neck
narrow or shallow chest
soft back
rounded back
tail low set
crooked legs, O-shaped or X-shaped
pasterns too sloping or straight
hock angles sharp or straight
brindle coloration
black mask


==== Eliminating faults ====
resemblance to other breeds: Caucasian Shepherd Dog, Central Asian Shepherd Dog, Sharplaninets, Landseer, etc.
overshot
undershot, with gap between the incisors of more than 3 mm.
phlegmatic temperament
timid temperament
unreasonable aggressiveness
one-colored coat
straight tail
soft and/or curly hair
no undercoatN.B. Male dogs should have two apparently normal testicles fully descended into the scrotum.
