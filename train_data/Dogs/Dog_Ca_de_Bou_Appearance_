According to the FCI standard, this dog should be a medium-sized, typical molosser with a slightly rectangular build. It is strong and powerful, with a deep and wide chest and a somewhat slimmer croup. The skin is thick and somewhat loose, but must not form folds except for a minor one on the throat.
The head is powerfully built and in males, the circumference of the skull should exceed the height of the dog. They have strong jaws with a very mild underbite, and widely spaced canines. The tail is set low, thick and is carried in a slight arch when the dog is moving.
Height and weight is for males 55–58 cm and 35–38 kg, for females 52–55 cm and 30–34 kg. It is a rather medium-sized dog, but can because of its mass appear larger than it really is.
The colors are fawn (light brown, often in deep tones), brindle, and black (often with tan markings). White markings are permitted, but must not exceed 30% of the full coat of the dog.
The size, shape and temperament varies greatly between lines. In central Europe, a far stockier dog with a shorter, slightly wrinkled face is more common. While in Spain, Scandinavia and other countries, the original, taller, leaner and more functional dog is most common.
