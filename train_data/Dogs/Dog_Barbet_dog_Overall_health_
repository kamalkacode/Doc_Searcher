== Overall health ==
 
Due to the extremely low number of barbets in the world, little is known about long term health issues. Some issues that have exhibited themselves are ear infections, hip dysplasia, hernias, undescended testicles, undershot/overshot bites, and epilepsy. However, a study has just begun in France about health issues in the barbet as several breeds have recently "contributed" to the Barbet. Most breeders today hipscore the parents before any matings and A, B, and C hipscores can be used.
The most common of these issues are ear infections, a problem in most water dog varieties. Ear problems can be minimized by proper ear care. A veterinarian should be consulted if the dog shows signs of an ear infection. The ear should always be clear of any hair, and inspected very regularly.


=== Hip dysplasia ===
Like the poodle group of breeds, the Barbet is vulnerable to hip dysplasia. The risk of a Barbet developing the condition can be greatly reduced by thoroughly checking the pedigrees and health clearances in both the sire and dam of the dog.


=== Lifespan ===
Lifespan of the Barbet averages 13â€“15 years, with one recorded living until 19 years of age.
