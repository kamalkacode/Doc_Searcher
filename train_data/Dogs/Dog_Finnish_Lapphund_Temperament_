The Finnish Lapphund is a very intelligent and active breed.  Finnish Lapphunds take well to training due to their intelligence.  Some owners and fanciers claim that "Lappies" even have the ability to think through actions first.  Although small in number worldwide, a noticeable number of Finnish Lapphunds have excelled in activities such as obedience trials, agility, herding trials, and pet therapy.
The breed is friendly and alert, and makes a good watch dog, due to its tendency to bark at unfamiliar things.  The breed was originally used to herd reindeer by droving, and barking helped it to be distinguished from wolves.  Even when not herding, the Finnish Lapphund tends to bark with a purpose, and more rare cases of problem barking can normally be controlled by training.
The breed makes the ideal outdoor companion.  It is active, coldproof, and waterproof, and will gladly accompany people on walking or running trips. A slight independent streak is common, though with training Finnish Lapphunds can have excellent recall and obedience skills.
Lappies are ideal choice for a family with small children. The breed adapts well to family life, including being responsive to children.  Finnish Lapphunds have a gentle nature with children, people with disabilities, and the elderly. This is a very friendly breed and it normally avoids and flees from threatening situations. The breed is very curious, so some supervision is recommended.

In Finland, many Finnish Lapphunds have won national championships for obedience and lappies are also suitable for agility.
