=== Golden Retriever ===

Towards the end of the 19th century, Sir Dudley Coutts Majoribanks, Lord Tweedmouth, was developing a breed which was known at the time as a "yellow Retriever". This was unusual, as typically during this period all Retrievers were black. The main pairing from which the modern Golden Retrievers are said to have descended were from a dog named Nous that was a rare yellow Wavy-coated Retriever, and a female Tweed Spaniel named Belle that was given to Majoribanks by his cousin David Robertson. Four yellow puppies were produced from this pairing, named Ada,  Crocus, Primrose and Cowslip.Belle was not the only Tweed Spaniel in Majoribank's kennel. A further dog simply named Tweed was kept, although records show he was never bred, as he died at an early age. A second dog named Tweed was bred, to Cowslip from the previous Tweed/Retriever pairing which produced a further yellow puppy named Topsy. The two breeds were only crossbred two or three times, but began the development of the modern Golden Retriever.


=== Curly Coated Retriever ===
During the formation of the modern breed known as the Curly-coated Retriever, several breeds were used to bring their characteristics into this new breed. These included Poodles, Wetterhouns, Barbets, Irish Water Spaniels, and breeds that are now extinct, including the Large Rough Water Dog and the Tweed Water Spaniel. The Curly-coated Retriever has been considered purebred since the early 20th century.
