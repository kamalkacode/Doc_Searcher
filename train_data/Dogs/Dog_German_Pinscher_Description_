== Description ==

The German Pinscher is a medium-sized dog, usually weighing between 25–45 pounds (11–20 kilograms) and typically 17–20 inches (43–51 centimetres) in height, with a short coat. Colors for this breed include black and rust, red, fawn, blue and tan.  The ideal German Pinscher is elegant in appearance with a strong square build and moderate body structure, muscular and powerful endurance and agility. For all countries where the Fédération Cynologique Internationale standard applies, only black and rust and solid red are allowed colors. Colors that became extinct during the world wars of the twentieth century include solid black, salt-and-pepper, and harlequin.
German Pinschers previously had their tails docked and ears cropped in countries where the procedures are legal. Historically, tail docking was thought to prevent rabies, strengthen the back, increase the animal's speed, and prevent injuries when working. Ears also were cropped, as they were thought to prevent injuries while working and increase the intense appearance of the canine. Today, these are done mainly for cosmetic reasons, although most countries are moving away from the procedure that has been found to be unnecessary for most dogs in their new life as pets and activity partners.
