== Origin and history ==
The Labrador Husky originated in Labrador, the northern mainland region of what is currently called the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The breed was brought to the area by the Thule Inuit people in 1300 AD. Although Labrador Huskies were once very closely related to other Northern husky breeds, like the Siberian Husky, they became isolated in Labrador thus develop independently of the other breeds.
Their history of being bred with wolves does not mean that they are wolf-dogs, nor do they have any recent wolf ancestry. However, they still retain some of their wolf-like physical features. Although they have been isolated, some Labradorian people have introduced the blood of the Alaskan Malamute in order to improve its sledding skills and later for trainability purposes, the German Shepherd Dog. This has created another sled dog that looks strikingly similar to the Siberian Husky, but is much larger and more wolf-like.

This breed had helped people to lead sleds until snowmobiles were invented. From then on, it got much less common for the dog to be used as a sled dog to lead heavy loads. These days, it is often the case that the breed is seen in dog races or help to find and save lost people. However, most people have the dogs as their house pets now.
