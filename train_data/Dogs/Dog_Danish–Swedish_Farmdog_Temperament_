The Danish–Swedish Farmdog is a very friendly, easygoing breed.  Not only does it work on farms as a rat extinguisher and alerting to intruders, but it is also a companion to adults, and is known to befriend and play with the children of the household.
The Danish–Swedish Farmdog is unlike a terrier - even though it is often mistaken as one - it is very mild and gentle in temper. Unlike the high-strung nature of the terrier, the nature of the DSF allows it to do its job, as well as be calm and loving during times without work. This makes it an ideal house companion.
The DSF is a not a high energy dog, but loves having a job.  The breed is new to the USA, and can only now start to be seen in sports such as flyball and dog agility.  The DSF is also known for its excellent mousing skills and can perform sports such as going to ground and earthdog.  They are also very speedy and quick, and love all types of lure coursing.
In 2010, the breed club, Danish-Swedish Farmdogs USA, made application to AKC-FSS for recognition of the breed.  In January 2011, the American Kennel Club (AKC) added the breed to its Foundation Stock Service.  The Danish-Swedish Farmdog is now eligible to compete in various AKC companion events such as obedience, agility, rally and more.  In November 2011, the AKC announced that as of July 2012, FSS breeds would be eligible for Open Conformation shows.
