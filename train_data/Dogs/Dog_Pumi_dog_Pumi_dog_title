The Pumi (in Hungarian, the plural form is pumik) is a medium-small breed of sheep dog from Hungary.  They are versatile stock dogs equally adept at gathering, driving and keeping stock under control. They have a long head with semi-erect ears, a whimsical expression, and a tail that forms a circle over the back. The coat (black, white, grey, or fawn) is a combination of wavy and curly hair forming curls all over the body.
The Pumi is considered to have arisen from the cross-breeding of Hungarian Pulik with French and German herding dogs from the 17th century onwards.  The international breed standard was approved in 1935.  The Pumi became an officially recognised breed in the US in 2011 and in the UK in 2015.  There are over 2,000 Pumis registered in Hungary, with notable populations in Finland and Sweden and small but growing numbers of registrations in the US, UK and Germany.
Some refer to the Pumi as the "Hungarian herding terrier" because it has some terrier-like attributes such as quick movement, alert temperament, and a quadratic, lean and muscular body type.
