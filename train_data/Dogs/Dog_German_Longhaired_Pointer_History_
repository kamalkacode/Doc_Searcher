== History ==

The GLP was developed in Germany for use as a pointer. It was originally a rather slow dog, and was crossed with setters and English Pointers in the 19th century to improve speed. It was very stubborn and temperamental, and has since been bred for a steady, friendly temperament. It was first shown in 1878 in Frankfurt, at which time the first breed standard was written. Breeders then began to focus their efforts on producing dogs that performed equally well in the field and the show ring, an endeavour continued by breeders today.Function became preferred over form.  As Karl Brandt, an early expert and theorist on this breed and its precursors, wrote in the llustrierten Jagdzeitung (1883) that: "At field competitions (trials), which should be part of breeding programs, the dogs will hopefully prove that they have not lost their natural hunting ability during the years when only looks dictated breeding" (i.e, pre 1878.)  five genealogical sires, constituting separate but parallel lines, are within the Longhair breed.Like most of the longhaired pointing breeds, the breed is descended from the point spaniel. One of the oldest of the "versatile breeds," it is but one of a few that disallow black as a color.  The Large Munsterlander was developed from the GLP after it was decided that GLPs must only be brown-and-white (there were thoughts that coloration also involved some undesirable characteristics), the black-and-white strain became the ancestors of the Large Munsterlander.This breed now is a multipurpose field dog that combines: pointer, retriever (including water work), setter and tracker (of wounded game).Breeding lines have been recorded in the Foundation Stock Service since May 2010; and effective July 1, 2011 the breed is approved to compete in AKC Performance Events.
