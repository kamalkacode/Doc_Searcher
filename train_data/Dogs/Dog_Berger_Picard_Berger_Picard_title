The Berger Picard  (pronounced "Bare-ZHAY Pee-CARR" or /bɛrˈʒeɪ pɪˈkar/) or Picardy Shepherd is a French breed of dog of the herding group of 
breeds. Berger is the French word for shepherd and Picardie is the region of France where they originate. Owners and fanciers call them simply Picards. These dogs nearly became extinct after both World War I and World War II and remain a rare breed. This breed of dog is people-oriented, loyal, and can make a good family pet if properly socialized early in life.
The producers of the 2005 American movie Because of Winn-Dixie brought five Picards over from Europe ("Scott", "Laiko" and "Tasha" performed in the movie). The trainer wanted a dog that resembled the scruffy mutt on the original book's cover but needed several that looked alike so that production could continue smoothly, thus he decided on this rare purebred dog from France. It is this breed's rustic mutt-like appearance that has prevented it from being rapidly popularized and exploited in the United States by the movie release, as has been the fate of some other breeds. People often mistakenly think "Winn-Dixie" is a mixed breed.Like any breed of dog, the Picardy Shepherd is not for everyone, and much thought must be devoted to choosing the right dog. As more Picard puppies are imported into the US from France and other countries, it is important that owners and future breeders remain responsible; they will determine the fate of this breed in the United States. In 2006 the Berger Picard Club of America was formed to help promote and protect this breed. The Berger Picard was fully recognized in the herding group by the American Kennel Club as of 1 July 2015.
