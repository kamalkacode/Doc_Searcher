== Temperament ==
The American Eskimo is an affectionate, loving dog. The breed is easy to train and they are excellent with children because of the dog's high intelligence and its willingness to please.  American Eskimos often rank among the top scorers in obedience trials. They like to work. Naturally wary of strangers, once properly introduced, they become friends. American Eskimos are highly intelligent, inquisitive and love to investigate. Without enough mental and physical exercise, they can become hyperactive and high-strung, spinning in circles. They are not always recommended for first-time dog owners, but with some advice from a trainer, can be a great pet.
The American Kennel Club standard states:

The American Eskimo Dog is intelligent, alert, and friendly, although slightly conservative. It is never overly shy nor aggressive, and such dogs are to be severely penalized in the show ring. At home it is an excellent  watchdog, sounding a warning bark to announce the arrival of any stranger. It is protective of its home and family, although it does not threaten to bite or attack people. The American Eskimo Dog learns new tasks quickly and is eager to please.
