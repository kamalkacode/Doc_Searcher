=== Appearance ===
There are a number of breed standards for the Patterdale Terrier. The most notable is that of the United Kennel Club (UKC) and the American Dog Breeders Association (ADBA), both in the United States, since the United Kingdom Kennel Club does not currently recognize the Patterdale Terrier.
The UKC standard states that dogs are between 25 and 40 centimetres tall, and specifies that dogs should be in fit, working condition. The UKC standard further specifies:

An active little terrier that presents a compact, balanced image. As a working terrier, they have to be capable of squeezing through very small passages underground to follow quarry. This breed is worked far more than it is shown, and breeders are primarily concerned with the practicality of the breed. This terrier must have a strong neck, the fortitude to hold its quarry at bay, the ability to squeeze into tight burrows, and great flexibility and endurance.


==== Coat and Colour ====

The coat may be one of three types: "smooth," "broken," or "rough."  

Smooth coat: Short, glossy hair. Undercoat still usually present.
Broken coat: Coarse. May be some longer whiskering on muzzle and chin.
Rough coat: Longer hair overall, including face, ears, and muzzle. Very thick, protective double coat.All coat types should have dense and coarse double coats that are harsh to the touch and weatherproof. 
Colours include black, red, bronze, black and tan, chocolate, liver, or even liver and tan, along with the rare blue (which has a slate colored nose), and occasionally brindle, but never fully white. Any other colours, or larger patches of white away from the chest and toes, are indicative of cross-breeding, particularly with the Jack Russell Terrier.


=== Temperament ===
Patterdale Terrier puppies tend to be bold and confident beyond their capabilities. The Patterdale is known as a working terrier, rather than a show dog. Typical of terriers, whose work requires high energy and a strong drive to pursue prey, Patterdales are very energetic and can be difficult to socialise. Though also kept as pets, due to being bred for high-intensity work, they may tend towards being too energetic for a sedentary household life.
