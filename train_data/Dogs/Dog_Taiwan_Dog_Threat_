=== Crossbreeding ===
The introduction of a variety of foreign dogs to Taiwan in the past was also a big threat to preserving the blood line of the Formosan.  A lot of dogs non-native to Taiwan were brought over during the "Kuomingtang" Era, and many were released into the wild.  These began mating with the native Formosan, making pure bred Formosans harder and harder to find in the wild.


=== Breeding problems ===
The Formosan Mountain Dog was originally kept by aboriginal Taiwanese as hunting dogs, but now purebred Formosans are extremely rare and valuable. Since pure Formosans are extremely rare, there is a high risk of genetic disorder and unstable behavior due to the shallow gene pool. For this reason, crossing Foromosans with other breeds occurred often due to the lack of pure females with steady traits. This is one of the major reasons modern Formosans look different, compared to old photos or documents from the early days. Some insist it is a natural change which does not affect the whole breed, while others actively fight to preserve the "pure" bloodline. Nevertheless, this breed is now popular all across the island as a watch and companion dog.


=== Dog meat ===
Dog meat is known as "fragrant meat" (香肉 xiāng ròu) in Taiwan. Dog meat was never commonly eaten in general, and when it was eaten, it was usually only eaten during winter.  But those that did partake in eating dog meat would frequently consume the meat of the black Formosan.  In Traditional Chinese Medicine, dog meat was claimed to help retain body warmth. In 2004 though, consuming dog meat was banned by the Taiwanese government, due to both pressure from domestic animal-welfare groups and a desire to improve international perceptions, although there were some protests to the ban.
It is still possible to find dog meat in some rural areas, but this is becoming increasingly rare.
