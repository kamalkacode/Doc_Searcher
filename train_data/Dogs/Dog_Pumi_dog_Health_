== Health ==
Pumis have a typical life expectancy of 12 to 14 years, but have been known to live to 19 years. Known medical issues are a knee problem called  patella luxation and canine hip dysplasia.  Responsible breeders have DNA testing performed for degenerative myelopathy and an eye disease called primary lens luxation, although neither is common. They also screen for patellar luxation and sometimes for elbow dysplasia.


=== Hip Dysplasia ===
Hip dysplasia is an abnormal formation of the hip socket that can lead to serious joint problems for the dog.  It is a genetic trait also affected by environmental factors, and can be identified by X-Ray.  It is probably the most common health problem specific to the breed.  Tests on 93 Pumis in America found that about 9 per cent had abnormal hips.Health records of the breed from Finland and Sweden indicate that 80 per cent of the Pumis born there have healthy hips.


=== Degenerative Myelopathy ===
Degenerative myelopathy is an incurable, progressive disease of the canine spinal cord, found typically after the age of seven years.  Pumis can be carriers of the trigger gene.  DNA testing can identify those dogs that are carriers, and these should not be bred with other carriers.  Twenty per cent of 65 Pumis tested in the US were found to be carriers.


=== Primary Lens Luxation ===
Primary Lens Luxation is a dislocation of the eye's lens.  This is also a genetic disease, for which the carrier gene can be identified by DNA testing.  Of 60 Pumis tested in the US, about 22 per cent were found to be carriers.


=== Elbow Dysplasia ===
Elbow dysplasia involves developmental abnormalities of the elbow-joint, and the growth of cartilage or the structures surrounding it, leading to osteoarthritis. As of 2016, none of the Pumi tested in the UK have recorded abnormal scores.


=== Testing ===
According to the Hungarian Pumi Club of America, the tests that are recommended for the Pumi are:
Hip Dysplasia (X-ray)
Patellar Luxation (veterinary certification)
Primary Lens Luxation (DNA test)
Degenerative Myelopathy (DNA Test)
Eye examination by an ophthalmologist (optional)
Elbow Dysplasia (optional) (X-ray)
DNA repository (optional) (blood sample)
