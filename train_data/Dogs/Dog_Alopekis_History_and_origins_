== History and origins ==
The oldest representation comes from prehistoric neolithic times. It is an inscribed terracotta vessel dating back to 3000 years BC from Thessaly, bearing the schematic outline of the characteristic silhouette of the Alopekis and is now at the Archaeology Museum of Athens. This relic places the breed in the same era and geographic location as the proto-Hellenic Πελασγοί (Pelasgians) people. It is the oldest dog artefact in the Hellenic world. A similar artefact was found in Asketario, Rafina and dated from the Early Bronze Age.Dog domestication in the Hellenic geographical region pre-dates, based on the analyses of the findings so far, the pro-ceramic Neolithic era, which in Greece started in the 7th millennium BC. Dog bones similar to those described as turf-dogs or marshland dogs or dogs of peat or dogs of the lake-dwellers (Canis familiaris palustris) were found in the oldest strata of the neolithic settlements at Sitagroi and Sesklo. The fact that these settlements and findings are much older than the central-European ones (in some instances twice as old) allows for the reasonable hypothesis that the ancestor of the European Spitz breeds (assumed to be Canis familiaris palustris Rütimeyer), did not actually first emerge in Central Europe but in the region of Greece; therefore Alopekis is a strong candidate as one of the oldest breeds/landraces, if not the oldest dog type to emerge in Europe; something that it would be very interesting to test in the laboratory, by comparing DNA from the neolithic bones and contemporary specimens.
Another name used for the breed in ancient times was Κυναλώπηξ [Cynalopex, from the Greek cyn (short for kyon) = dog and alopex = fox] as the ancient Greeks believed It was created from matings between dogs and foxes. Newer traditional local names recorded include Alepouditsa (little fox), Bobis and Bouboudi (from Serres), Moropa / Venetaki (used in Crete), Zacharoskylo (sugar – dog, referring to the spotless white colour of some specimen, as well as their sweet nature, used in Skiathos).
