The Labrador Husky has a similar temperament to other Northern breeds such as Siberian Husky, Alaskan Husky, Alaskan Malamute, Canadian Eskimo Dog and so forth. It rarely barks but does tend to howl. The breed can be friendly and not aggressive with strangers and is well behaved if socialized properly. They are also good at getting along with family members and are intelligent and loyal animals. These dogs often do well with children as well, especially if reared with them together.Being with other dogs makes them happier because they are bred to work well in a pack. However, its strong prey drive might make it dangerous for owners to have smaller pets with it, but if they meet each other in their early ages, it should be safe.In general, it is required for owners of dogs to be the leader of their pack. Owners of wolf-hybrid dogs such as this breed are encouraged to understand the importance of being pack leaders more deeply. In addition, owners need plenty of time to take care of the dogs because they require a good deal of exercise and owners' attention as well as mental stimulation.
