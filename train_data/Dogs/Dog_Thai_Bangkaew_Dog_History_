== History ==
Bangkaew is a village located in the Bang Rakam District, Phitsanulok Province in the central region of Thailand. In this district, near the Yom River, there is a monastery called Wat Bangkaew where it is believed that Thai Bangkaew Dogs originated.
Legend has it that the third abbot of Bangkaew Temple, the respected Luang Puh Maak Metharee, was known for mercy and giving care to all living things. An old Bangkaew villager named Tah Nim gave the abbot a native bitch. Because she was pregnant without any dog in the area, her mating was thought to be either a golden jackal (Canis aureus) or a dhole (Cuon alpinus) living in the surrounding forest.  A chromosome study of Thai Bangkaew dog confirmed that the breed is the result of domestic dog and jackal interbreed. The resulting litter produced longhaired puppies of black and dark brown coloration. Luang Puh Maak Metharee raised the resulting puppies, four females.
Seasonal rain produced flooding, a natural barrier that limited the dogs contributing to the gene pool. Inbreeding that took place led to the creation of the Thai Bangkaew Dogs. From then on the breed has been selectively bred and has become one of the most favored varieties of Thai dogs.
