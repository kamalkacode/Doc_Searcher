Nevado was Simón Bolívar's dog, and was with him during voyages and battles until his death.When arriving at a local mansion, the Hacienda Moconoque, Simón Bolívar was received by "Nevado", which despite being a puppy was not intimidated before the weapons and threats of the army men. De Mendoza explained that Bolívar was surprised at the dog's courage, who did not allow the group to enter the hacienda until its master came out. Nevado accompanied him throughout the campaign, fought in several countries and often saved his life. One popular story tells that Nevado was abducted by the royalist army, which did not kill him because they thought the dog would lead them to Bolivar. However, the dog escaped and reunited with Bolivar. Nevado was killed by a spear during the Battle of Carabobo on 24 June 1821, which sealed Venezuela's independence from the Spanish Crown. Nevado also appears in various historical paintings and a known statue which features him alongside the Indian Tinjacá in Mucuchíes.
