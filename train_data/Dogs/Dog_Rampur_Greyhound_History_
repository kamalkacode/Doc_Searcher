== History ==

His Royal Highness Ahmad Ali Khan of Rampur, Nawab of Rampur State, bred these dogs by combining the blood lines of very powerful but ferocious T훮z카, brought in by the Afghans, and the English Greyhound that was more obedient but less resistant to the varying climatic conditions. He gave the name 'Rampur Hound' to the dogs he bred. The Rampur Hound far exceeded his expectations. While it got its looks and stalwart character from its T훮z카 Afghan ancestors, from the English Greyhound it got its speed. Here was a dog that would seldom back down in confrontations, and could more or less keep up with the fastest prey.
With the fall from power of the Maharajahs in 1947, so too fell the popularity of the Rampur Hound. The effect of the arrival of the English was evident to the Rampur, as well as the native Indian people. Additional English greyhound was bred into some of the lines, making it very difficult to find a purebred Rampur Greyhound today. 
With the decline in hunting in India the dog's popularity plummeted. It was no longer fashionable or practical for the rich to keep them, while the poorer population simply could not afford to keep one. In recent years, however, its popularity has begun to rise once more, and the breed's numbers along with this.
Nonetheless, this remarkable breed still balances on the edge of extinction. Only a handful are known and registered outside of India, with all current known individuals outside India being currently located in the U.S. state of New Jersey.
