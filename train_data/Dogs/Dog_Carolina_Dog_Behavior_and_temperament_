== Behavior and temperament ==


=== Breeding in the wild ===
Female Carolina dogs have three estrus cycles in quick succession, which settle into seasonal reproductive cycles when there is an abundance of puppies. This is thought to ensure quick breeding in the wild before diseases, like heartworm, take their toll.Some pregnant dogs also dig dens in which to give birth. Unlike domesticated dogs, wolves, or coyotes, pregnant female Carolina dogs may dig elaborate dens. After giving birth or while pregnant, the dog carefully pushes sand with her snout to cover her excrement. This also helps to evade wolves and coyotes, showing further behavioral adaptation to the wild. Brisbin noted that only the Australian dingo and one ancient Korean breed of dog exhibit this behavior.


=== Hunting ===
The Carolina dog is highly proficient at locating prey with its elongated, swiveling, radar-like ears, and is equally proficient at catching small mammals, such as shrews and mice, using a pouncing technique similar to foxes. The dog also digs "snout pits" or "nose holes" – numerous of tiny holes in the dirt that perfectly fit its muzzle – usually for hunting small rodents, insects, or grubs, or to eat soil minerals. (More female dogs dig these than males.)


=== Elusive of humans ===
In the wild, the Carolina dog usually avoids people, often living in sparsely settled land instead of the highly populated areas that stray dogs commonly occupy. However, there are sizable wild populations in metropolitan Atlanta's wooded areas, even near industrial plants and major highways.


=== Sociability and socialization ===
Though Carolina dogs may be more sensitive to hierarchy than other breeds, they are gregarious and playful, and can form close bonds with other dogs. They may be happier in captivity in "packs" of two or more animals.
