== Appearance ==
The Tahltan was built somewhere between the lines of the spitz and pariah types. The ideal dog was, above all else, athletic and agile.
As they were always bred solely for hunting value, appearance could vary significantly between dogs.


=== Coat and colour ===
A Tahltan Bear Dog was primarily black, dark brown or blue, with some white patches on the chest and sometimes the feet. Standing 14 to 17 inches high at the shoulder, with relatively large, erect pointed ears, with a refined, pointed muzzle. The glossy coat was of average length, with guard hairs covering a thicker undercoat. Paws some what webbed and relatively large for the size of the dog. They were bred to be double jointed and gaited, enabling them to switch gaits as they moved through different terrain or heavy brush, as were all the aboriginal dogs of the North and South American continents. 
Like others of their group, they had a peculiar yodel. Foxy in appearance, their main distinction among dogs is their novel tail. Short, bushy and carried erect, it has been described variously as a shaving brush or a whisk broom.
