== Domestication ==
The Labrador Husky had its first contact with humans was when it was used primarily as a working dog. This dog was not thought of as a pet but rather as an animal used for the benefit of the people who put it to work. It was commonly thought that this type of dog was not a friendly breed and would not be good in a family setting primary because of its past. This notion has since been disproven, as the Labrador Husky has become a fairly common family pet. There are still groups of people like the Labrador Inuit and Metis who use the Labrador Husky in its undomesticated form for recreational dog sledding and, some even prefer to use a dog team instead of a snowmobile. Sled dog racing continues to be a winter pastime in Labrador, with long races similar to the Iditarod still happening today.The process of domesticating a Labrador Husky does not stray far from what you would do in order to train a more commonly known family dog like a Golden Retriever. Because of its extremely high level of intelligence, the Labrador Husky must be very well trained. This breed of dog is known to respond well to training by an owner or professional who uses positive reinforcement. It is best to start training while these dogs are still puppies so that no bad habits develop. Lack of training and an owner who is not committed to the dog's overall needs will prove to be detrimental to the dogs behavior. The Labrador Husky loves to be surrounded by other dogs for companionship. Contact with other dogs and humans is vital for the dogs overall mental health and ability to be able to function in an urban setting. They are now often kept as a house pet.
