== Shedding ==

Like most mammals, all dogs slough off dander, or flake dead skin. Since dander and many other allergens become trapped in hair, the susceptibility of allergies acting up is dependent of the amount of hair shed and the weight of the hair.  As the amount of hair shed increases, and the weight of the hair decreases, the probability of airborne hair, dander and allergens increases.  This will, therefore, increase one's allergies to a particular animal.  Lhasas have long coarse hair, which causes the weight of the hair to be heavy.  Due to the long length of hair, Lhasa Apsos do not shed hair the same way as other breeds.  Instead, they shed hair like humans, slowly and continuously, as to keep their hygiene clean and risk of matting and tangling low.   The long, heavy hair prevents individual hair strands to become airborne, and decreases the amount of dander in the air as compared to other breeds. People with allergies may co-exist with the low-shedding breeds of dogs, like the Lhasa Apso.
Coming from the extremely cold weather of the Himalayas, the Lhasa has a double coat:  an under coat to keep them warm and an outer coat consisting of guard hairs for protection and aiding to keep their coat flat and smooth. The outer coat consisting of the guard hair should be similar to human hair, you should be able to feel individual hair strands when touched.  While the undercoat is softer and finer, it should lay flat and blend in with the outer coat.  
Routine brushing and bathing is necessary, not only to keep up on the slow continuous shedding, but to also remove any dirt and debris that may get caught within the hair strands.  A Lhasa with a thick coarse outer coat will likely require less grooming than a Lhasa with a lot of under coat and soft, less coarse, top coat.
