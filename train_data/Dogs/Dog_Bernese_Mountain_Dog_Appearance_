=== Four breeds of Sennenhund ===
The four breeds of Sennenhund, with the original breed name, followed by the most popular English version of the breed name:

Grosser Schweizer Sennenhund, Greater Swiss mountain dog
Berner Sennenhund, Bernese mountain dog
Appenzeller Sennenhund, Appenzeller
Entlebucher Sennenhund, Entlebucher mountain dog


=== Colouring ===
Like the other Sennenhunde, the Bernese mountain dog is a large, heavy dog with a distinctive tri-colored coat, black with white chest and rust colored markings above eyes, sides of mouth, front of legs, and a small amount around the white chest. An ideal of a perfectly marked individual gives the impression of a white horseshoe shape around the nose and a white “Swiss cross” on the chest, when viewed from the front. A “Swiss kiss” is a white mark located typically behind the neck, but may be a part of the neck. A full ring would not meet type standard. The AKC breed standard lists, as disqualifications, blue eye color, and any ground color other than black.


=== Height and weight ranges ===
Height at the withers is 24–28 in (61–71 cm) for males, while it is 22–26 in (56–66 cm) for females. Weight is 80–120 lb (35–55 kg) for males, while it is 70–110 lb (30–50 kg) for females.


=== Build and proportions ===
The Bernese mountain dog is slightly longer than it is tall, and it is highly muscular.


=== Other physical traits ===
The head of the Bernese mountain dog is flat on the top with a moderate stop, and the ears are medium-sized, triangular, set high, and rounded at the top. The teeth have a scissors bite. The legs of the Bernese are straight and strong, with round, arched toes. The dewclaws of the Bernese are often removed. Its bushy tail is carried low.
