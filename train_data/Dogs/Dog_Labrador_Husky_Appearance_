== Appearance ==
The Labrador Husky is a fairly large dog that can weigh between 60 and 100 pounds and can grow to 20 - 28 inches.  Thick, double coated fur protects these dogs from the bitterly cold temperatures that come with Labrador's long winters.
The husky's head is broad and has a long, narrow muzzle. The chest is wide and heavy boned. The husky's muscular and stout body is a unique physical trait, especially when compared to a Siberian Husky. Coat colors include solid white, solid black, black and white, red and white, and grey and white. There are two rare coat colors that can also be found in this breed: wolf grey and solid grey. Any coat color can appear in any litter; the most common colors are black and white, gray and white, and solid black.This breed has existed for hundreds of years and has become a unique breed due to its isolation from other northern dog breeds over this time. Labrador Huskies were used for transportation for many years until the advent of the snowmobile.
Today, in isolated communities in northern Labrador, spaying and neutering is extremely expensive and logistically difficult. Dog breeding is therefore largely unmonitored and uncontrolled. This has resulted in a great variety of Labrador Husky mixes. It is unclear how many "purebred" Labrador Huskies are left in their region of origin, but many of the mixes retain that distinctive wolf-like facial shape.
Of all the northern dog breeds, the Labrador Husky is one of the rarest, with less than an estimated 50-60 purebred Labrador Huskies currently identified in Labrador. As a result, the breed is not well understood by many dog breeders.
