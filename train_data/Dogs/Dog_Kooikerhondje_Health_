Kooikers have good appetites and a tendency to put on weight easily. Their life span is 12â€“14 years. As Kooikerhondjes have a small genetic base, hereditary diseases were somewhat prevalent earlier. These include:

von Willebrand's disease, a blood clotting disorder
Cataract and other eye diseases
Patellar luxation
Hereditary Necrotising Myelopathy (ENM) a fatal neurologic disease
Polymyositis
Kidney disordersToday (due to a lot of hard work in the national clubs) most Kooikers used for breeding are free from von Willebrands disease (most national clubs require both male and female dogs to be free from this disease to be allowed to breed).
Patellar luxation is not a major problem in most countries at the moment, but is kept under a close watch to prevent it from becoming a problem again. In the Netherlands, eye tests are available and all breeders breeding according to the breed club's rules have to test their dogs. Only dogs that are free of eye diseases are allowed to be used for breeding. Testing for ENM became available in  2012. In the Netherlands, only dogs who are tested may be used for breeding. Only allowed breedings are Free x Free or Free X Carrier. Carrier to Carrier should never be done as the risk of this fatal disease is high. Puppy purchasers should inquire about the ENM status of the parents.
