The breed is an integral part of dog history, and many familiar breeds have Barbet in their ancestry. Depending on geography and necessity, the barbet connected through the centuries in various capacities, and as a companion dog, but more as an all-around working dog. The term barbet became throughout centuries a "generic" name for a dog with a long, curly, woolly coat.The Grand Barbet depicted in Count George Louis Buffon's book Histoire Naturelle (1750) is thought to be the original source of the various water dog breeds (poodles, Portuguese Water Dog, American Water Spaniel, and so on).  Its actual origin is lost in antiquity but may stem from corded-coat herding dog stock, also ancestral to breeds like the Komondor.Barbets have also worked as sailor's companions, much like the Portuguese Water Dog. It was best known for being a waterfowl retriever in the marshes, wetlands, and estuaries of France. This is where the expression "muddy as a barbet" came from in the 19th century. Between the late 18th to early 19th centuries, the same dog was known as the barbet in France, the barbone in Italy, and the Pudel in Germany; for almost a hundred years the barbets and poodles were considered the same breed.With the advent of dog shows and selective breeding based purely on aesthetics, the poodles were developed to be more elegant and of a solid colour, to distinguish them from their more common progenitors. The versatile nature of the Barbet has meant its survival, and many of today's Barbets still have traits of their ancestral stock lost in the poodle group. The Barbet's origins and bloodlines can be traced back to the writing of the first standard in 1891.The breed is gaining popularity in Scandinavian countries and North America as more and more people are becoming interested in this all-around working dog, often simply as a pet.
