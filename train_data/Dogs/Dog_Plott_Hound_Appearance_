== Appearance ==
The Plott Hound is generally athletic, muscular, and agile in appearance. This breed is rarely low-set or heavy and usually has a medium build. Unlike some other hounds the Plott's skin is not baggy. The Plott is a strongly built yet moderate hound, with a distinct brindle-colored coat. Its appearance suggests the capacity for speed, stamina and endurance. The Plott may have an identification mark on it that is used to identify the dog when hunting. Such a mark is not penalized in conformation shows.


=== Coat and color ===
The Plott Hound's hair should be fine to medium in texture, short or medium in length, and have a smooth and glossy appearance. According to the National Plott Hound Association, the dog's hair should be brindled. Brindled is defined as "Finely streaked or striped effect or pattern of black or tan hairs with hairs of a lighter or darker background color. Shades of colors accepted: yellow brindle, red brindle, tan brindle, brown brindle, black brindle, grey brindle, and maltese (slate grey, blue brindle)." Acceptable colors are any of the above-mentioned brindles. Black with brindle trim in the alternative. The Association dictates that while some white on chest and/or feet is permissible, white anywhere else is a fault.


=== Size ===
A Plott Hound should measure approximately 20 to 25 in (55 to 71 cm) at the withers for males, 20 to 23 in (53 to 63 cm) for females. Males should weigh 50 to 60 lb (23 to 27 kg). Females should weigh 40 to 55 lb (18 to 25 kg).
