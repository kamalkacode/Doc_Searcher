== Appearance ==
Kunming wolfdogs are typically medium-sized dog who fall under the spitz type category. Their height is 25–27 inches (64–68 cm) and weight is 66–84 pounds (30–38 kg). The head and body of the Kunming wolfdogs are similar in appearance to the German Shepherd except they stand taller in the back. They have seasonal coats that grow into a double layered coat during the late fall to the early winter but will later on shed into a shorter coat during the late spring. The tail is long like their German Shepherd cousins. Kunming wolfdogs occasionally lift their tails curled high when excited but they often carry it lower behind their back like their wolf ancestors do. Coats are marked with a black saddle and muzzle, with other colors ranging from light straw to deep rust.


=== Temperament ===
Kunming wolfdogs share similar behavioural traits to their German Shepherd ancestors. They are extremely intelligent, normally self-assured and are marked by their curiosity and willingness to learn which allows them to excel in task training. However, they are also highly active and require a lot of activities and ideally one long walk per day in order to keep them occupied. Like German Shepherds, Kunming wolfdogs are suitable to have around children when properly trained and supervised.
