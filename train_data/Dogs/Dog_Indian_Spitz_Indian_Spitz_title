The Indian Spitz is a spitz-type dog breed belonging to the Utility Dog group. It is very similar to the German Spitz in appearance but is roughly 1.5-2.5 inches shorter at the withers and weighs around 10-15 lbs less.
The Indian Spitz was one of the most popular dogs in India in the 1980s and the 1990s when India's import rules made it very difficult to import dogs of other breeds.
The Indian Spitz is often called Pomeranian though the two breeds are very different. The confusion arises from the fact that both breeds belong to the Spitz family, along with the Elk-Hound, German Spitz, Samoyed, Finnish Spitz, and many others.
The Indian Spitz was introduced in India by the British who began breeding them from a stock of German Spitzes. Years of breeding produced the ideal dog type which was suited to the plains of India and was capable of withstanding India's sultry climate. These Spitzes resembled Samoyeds and German Spitzes but had less thick coats and were smaller in size, which was ideal for the conditions.
Though they are not recognized by any major Kennel Club, The Indian Spitz is identified as a separate Indian Breed by the Kennel Club of India. It has now been working to establish the Indian Spitz as a separate breed at other Kennel Clubs around the world.
Generally Indian Spitzes are divided into two: the Smaller Indian Spitz/Lesser Indian Spitz (Roughly 5–7 kg [11–15 lb] in weight and 22–25 cm [8 1⁄2–10 in] at the withers) and the Greater Indian Spitz (Roughly 12–20 kg (26–44 lb) in weight and 35–45 cm (14–17 1⁄2 in) at the withers). The Indian Spitz is generally Milky White but can also be found in solid colours like Black, Dusky Brown and sometimes (very rarely) a hybrid of black and white (similar to the Dalmatian).
Most have a lifespan between 10 and 14 years; however some have been known to live up to 16 years of age.
