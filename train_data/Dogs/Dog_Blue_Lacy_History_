The Lacy dog was named after the Lacy brothers (Frank, George, Ewin, and Harry Lacy) who moved from Kentucky to Texas in 1858, settling in Burnet County, Texas. The dog, according to the Lacy family, was a mixture of English Shepherd (or perhaps coyote), greyhound, and wolf. Texas House Concurrent Resolution No. 108 also mentions scenthound. The brothers originally developed the dogs' natural herding instincts to work the family's free-roaming hogs.On March 15, 2005, in the 79th Legislature of the State of Texas, Representative Joaquin Castro at the request of the Texas Lacy Game Dog Association filed House Concurrent Resolution No. 108, proposing the blue Lacy as state dog of Texas.  This legislation was proposed to recognize the original breeders and their contribution to the State of Texas as well as to honor the Lacy as a Texas original.  House Concurrent Resolution No. 108 was adopted by the Texas House of Representatives on May 15, 2005, and by the Senate ten days later on May 25, 2005.  Governor Rick Perry signed the legislation adopting the Lacy as "the official State Dog Breed of Texas" on June 18, 2005.The Lacy was proposed by some in 2008 to replace Reveille VII, a collie, as the mascot dog of Texas A&M. In accordance with tradition since Reveille III, however, a collie was chosen.
