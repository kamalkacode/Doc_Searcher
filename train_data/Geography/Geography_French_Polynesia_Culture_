French is the only official language of French Polynesia. An organic law of 12 April 1996 states that "French is the official language, Tahitian and other Polynesian languages can be used." At the 2012 census, among the population whose age was 15 and older, 70.1% of people reported that the language they spoke the most at home was French (up from 68.5% at the 2007 census), 23.1% reported that the language they spoke the most at home was Tahitian (down from 24.2% at the 2007 census), 2.5% reported Marquesan and 0.2% the related Mangareva language, 1.3% reported Tuamotuan, 1.2% reported any of the Austral languages, 0.8% reported a Chinese dialect (almost half of which was Hakka), and 0.8% another language (two-third of which were English, Arabic, and Fijian, in that order).At the same census, 94.9% of people whose age was 15 or older reported that they could speak, read and write French (up from 94.7% at the 2007 census), whereas only 1.4% reported that they had no knowledge of French (down from 2.0% at the 2007 census). 87.8% of people whose age was 15 or older reported that they had some form of knowledge of at least one Polynesian language (up from 86.4% at the 2007 census), whereas 12.2% reported that they had no knowledge of any of the Polynesian languages (down from 13.6% at the 2007 census).


=== Music ===

French Polynesia came to the forefront of the world music scene in 1992, with the release of The Tahitian Choir's recordings of unaccompanied vocal Christian music called himene tƒÅrava, recorded by French musicologist Pascal Nabet-Meyer. This form of singing is common in French Polynesia and the Cook Islands, and is distinguished by a unique drop in pitch at the end of the phrases, which is a characteristic formed by several different voices; it is also accompanied by steady grunting of staccato, nonsensical syllables.


=== Religion ===
Christianity is the main religion of the islands. A majority of 54% belongs to various Protestant churches, especially the Maohi Protestant Church, which is the largest and accounts for more than 50% of the population. It traces its origins to Pomare II, the king of Tahiti, who converted from traditional beliefs to the Reformed tradition brought to the islands by the London Missionary Society.
Latin rite Roman Catholics constitute a large minority with 30% of the population, which has its own ecclesiastical province, comprising the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Papeete and its only suffragan, the Diocese of Taiohae. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had 25,841 members as of  2017. Community of Christ, another denomination within the Latter-Day Saint tradition, claimed 7,990 total French Polynesian members as of 2015 including Mareva Arnaud Tchong who serves in the church's governing Council of Twelve Apostles. There were about 3,000 Jehovah's Witnesses in Tahiti as of  2014.
