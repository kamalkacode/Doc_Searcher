The ground is made up of 4 stands:

Hazlewoods Stand (Whaddon Road) - capacity 1,100. An all-seated stand behind one of the goals, the Carlsberg Stand was opened in 2005 and is designated to away fans. For the 2009-10 season it was given to home supporters, but after one season it was returned to away fans.
Colin Farmer Stand (Wymans Road) - capacity 2,034. An all-seated stand that runs down one side of the pitch. The stand was opened in November 2001 and is home to the vocal "Wymans" supporters. For big games, two sections of the stand are given to away supporters. It was renamed the Colin Farmer Stand at the beginning of the 2016-17 season, in memory of Colin Farmer, a club legend.
Liberty Mutual Insurance Stand (Prestbury Road End) - capacity about 2,100. Opened in 1999, this is a covered terrace behind the other goal, the LMI Terrace is the home standing end.
Jelf Stand (Main Stand) - capacity about 1,800. Built in 1963, it is a mixture of terracing (Tunnel and Paddock enclosures) at the front and seating at the back. The Main Stand runs down on side of the pitch, but is unusual in that it does not stretch the full length of the touchline and does not reach either corner flag. It contains the players dressing rooms, hospitality, directors and press boxes. It also includes a family section.
