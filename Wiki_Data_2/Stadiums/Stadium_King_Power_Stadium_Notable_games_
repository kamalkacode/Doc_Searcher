==== International matches ====


=== Rugby Union ===
In 2004 Leicester Tigers considered sharing the stadium with Leicester City as their own 16,815-capacity ground at Welford Road was considered too small to handle the growing popularity of rugby union. The plan would have seen the two clubs form a jointly owned company to buy the stadium from Teachers. The deal was abandoned in 2005 as the clubs failed to fully agree terms. Because of the continued parlous state of the football club's finances, rumours groundsharing was still being discussed continued to circulate, with some suggestions Tigers were considering buying the stadium outright from Teachers. In 2007, a permanent groundshare seemed to be ruled out as Leicester Tigers received planning consent for a major expansion of their own Welford Road venue with a new 10,500-seat stand taking Welford Road to a capacity of 24,500.
However, Tigers have played six matches at the stadium The first three were either to capitalise on the larger capacity with the greater interest in high-profile games or when competition rules demanded the match be played away from their normal home ground while the other three was due to the demolition of the old Caterpillar Stand at Welford Road.

* Played in front of a sell-out crowd of 32,500, which is the record attendance for the stadium. (This number is unlikely to be equalled for a football match, unless the stadium is expanded due to crowd segregation requirements.)
With the expansion of Welford Road under way, it is likely the only rugby games to be played at the King Power Stadium in future will be European Cup semi-finals when Leicester Tigers are drawn at "home," which enables them to propose a suitable English venue away from their home ground.
It also hosted an exhibition match between World XV and South Africa XV on 3 December 2006 to mark the centenary of the Springboks' first game abroad. South Africa won 32–7.
The stadium hosted matches for the 2015 Rugby World Cup, hosting three pool matches: Argentina–Tonga, Argentina–Namibia and Canada–Romania.
