=== 3G artificial pitch ===
Rather than the traditional choice of grass, Maidstone were the first English team to build a stadium with third generation artificial turf. The reasons for going with the synthetic turf were threefold, the first being to eliminate match postponements caused by waterlogging and freezing conditions, the second so that the pitch can be hired out, bringing in vital funds (around £120,000 to £150,000 profit per year), and thirdly so that the stadium can be a hub for all the club's youth and community teams. The pitch currently hosts the home matches of the club's first team, academy (under 18s), under 16s-13s and under 7s-8s. It is also used for training among a large number of the club's teams, and in addition is hired out to other organisations for wider community use.A downside of the 3G pitch is that so far the club has only gained permission to use the pitch in the Football Conference (Conference National / North & South) downwards. As a result of this, promotion to The Football League will not be possible until permission is granted from the league or the 3G turf is replaced with grass. In a bid to overcome these hurdles, Maidstone United head up a group of professional clubs looking to promote the merits of 3G surfaces called '3G4US'.
However, as of the 2014–2015 competition, the FA allowed the use of 3G artificial pitches in every round of the FA Cup.The introduction of 3G pitches in the FA Cup meant that Maidstone were able to host Stevenage FC in a First Round FA Cup Replay in front of the BT Sport cameras, a game which they went on to win 2-1 and progress to the second round.In the summer of 2016, the club relaid the pitch ahead of the inaugural campaign in non league's top flight, the National League.


==== Reaction ====
Upon seeing his side play on the surface, former Brighton & Hove Albion manager Gus Poyet described the pitch as "magnificent" and "perfection". After taking part in a Charity match at the stadium, West Ham United legend Tony Cottee described the 3G facility as a "great idea", citing that the surface's ability to deal with adverse weather conditions meant it could be the way forward for non-league clubs.


=== Stands ===
There are stands on the north, east and south sides of the pitch. The west side of the stadium remains undeveloped for spectators apart from flat hard standing.
Main Stand: The main stand is situated on the eastern side of the ground. It includes 750 spectator seats, a press area, media room and two executive lounges. There is a further temporary media/press area attached, but separate, to this stand.
