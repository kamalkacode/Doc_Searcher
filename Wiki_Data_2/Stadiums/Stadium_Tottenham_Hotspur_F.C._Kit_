The first Tottenham kit included a navy blue shirt with a letter H on a scarlet shield on the left breast. In 1884, the club changed to a "quartered" kit similar in style to that of Blackburn Rovers after watching them win in the 1884 FA Cup Final. Shortly after moving to Northumberland Park, the kit changed again to red shirt and blue shorts. Five years later, after becoming a professional club, they switched to a chocolate and gold striped kit.In the 1898–99 season, their final year at Northumberland Park, the club switched colours to the white shirts and blue shorts. This colour choice was in homage to Preston North End who had recently done the Double. White and navy blue have remained as the club's basic colours ever since, with the white shirts giving the team the nickname "The Lilywhites". In 1921, after they had won the FA Cup, the cockerel badge was added to the shirt. In 1939 numbers first appeared on shirt backs.  In 1991, the club was the first to wear long-cut shorts, an innovation at a time when football kits all featured shorts cut well above the knee.The early supplier of Spurs' jerseys was a local firm on Seven Sisters Road, HR Brookes. In the 1920s, Bukta produced the jerseys for the club. From the mid-1930s onwards, Umbro supplied the kits for Spurs for forty years until it was replaced by Admiral in 1977, followed by Le Coq Sportif in 1980.. In 1985, Spurs entered into a business partnership with Hummel, who then supplied the strips. However, the attempt by Tottenham to expand the business side of the club failed, and in 1991, they returned to Umbro. This was followed by Pony in 1995, Adidas in 1999, and Kappa in 2002.  In 2006, they signed a five-year deal with Puma. In March 2011, Under Armour announced a five-year deal to supply Spurs with shirts and other apparel from the start of 2012–13. The home and away kits were revealed in July 2012 in London, with the third kit revealed the following month via the promotion of Electronic Arts' FIFA 13 video game.  The shirts incorporate technology that can monitor the players' heart rate and temperature and send the biometric data to the coaching staff.Shirt sponsorship in English football was first adopted by the non-league club Kettering Town F.C. in 1976, and this practice then spread to the major clubs. In December 1983, soon after the club was floated on the London Stock Exchange, Holsten became the first commercial sponsor logo to appear on a Spurs shirt. When Thomson was chosen as kit sponsor in 2002 some Tottenham fans were unhappy as the shirt-front logo was red, the colour of their closest rivals, Arsenal. In 2006, Tottenham secured a £34 million sponsorship deal with internet casino group Mansion.com. In July 2010, Spurs announced a two-year shirt sponsorship contract with software infrastructure company Autonomy said to be worth £20 million. A month later they unveiled a £5 million deal with leading specialist bank and asset management firm Investec as shirt sponsor for the Champions League and domestic cup competitions for the next two years. Since 2014, AIA has been the main shirt sponsor in a deal worth over £16 million annually.In June 2017, it was announced that Nike would be supplying Spurs' kits in a "multi-year agreement" after Under Armour's contract expired. The 2017–18 kit was released on 30 June, featuring the Spurs' crest encased in a shield, paying homage to Spurs' 1960–61 season, where they became the first post-war-club to win both the Football League First Division and the FA Cup.
