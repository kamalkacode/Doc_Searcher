=== West Stand ===
The largest of the stands, seating just under 4,000 home supporters on a match day, the West Stand also accommodates the club offices, changing rooms and supporters' bar.


=== Dave Bowen (North) Stand ===
Named after ex-Northampton Town player and manager Dave Bowen, who helped take the club from Division Four to the First Division during the 1960s, the North Stand is behind the goal nearest to the hill. It seats approximately 900.


=== Alwyn Hargrave (East) Stand ===
This is the Family Enclosure and stands opposite the West Stand. It can seat approximately 1,974 fans. It is usually reserved for home supporters, although if the opposition sell their allocation in The Paul Cox Panel & Paint (South) Stand, they are usually sent an extra 450 tickets for the south end of this stand. It is named after a former borough councillor who helped the stadium become reality. The stand was commended for its facilities for disabled supporters by The Football Ground Guide.


=== Moulton College (South) Stand ===
Standing opposite and identical to The Dave Bowen Stand, this end is reserved for away fans. Until the 2015/2016 season the only occasion on which this stand has held Northampton Town supporters was against Chester City on 29 April 2006 when the stand was split and supporters segregated to allow the maximum number of home supporters to witness the club's promotion to League One.
During the 2015â€“16 season, the stand was split between home and away fans numerous times because of high demand from Northampton Town fans.
This stand holds 900 fans.
