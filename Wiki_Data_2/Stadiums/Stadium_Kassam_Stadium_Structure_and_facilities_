A distinctive feature of the stadium is a reflective glass panelling that makes up the main entrance. Sections of the panelling have been subject to vandalism. 
The stadium offers a number of conference rooms to host corporate and non-corporate events. The stadium's South Stand is host to 28 private hospitality boxes with each box capable of holding up to 20 people.
The ground currently consists of three stands.

The North Stand (formerly known as the Manor Hospital or Weber BBQ Stand) is divided for use by both home and away supporters and has a capacity of 5,026.
The East Stand (formerly sponsored by the Oxford Mail newspaper, and still commonly known as the Oxford Mail Stand) is home to the more vocal home supporters and can hold 2,879 spectators.
The South Stand (currently without a sponsor) is the main structure of the stadium, housing the Quadrangle conference centre, the Exhibition Bar, the club offices and changing rooms, and a row of 28 glass-fronted executive boxes. The South Stand is divided into two tiers, with the lower tier including the ground's Family Section. It has a total capacity of 4,495.
In March 2008 a bronze statue of an ox was erected outside the stadium. The unveiling was attended by the boardroom staff and a few fans. The club released a statement saying the reason for the unveiling not being more publicised was because of health and safety concerns if the unveiling took place on a match day. The statue was vandalised in January 2011, when it was completely covered in bright pink paint.
