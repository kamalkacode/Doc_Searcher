On 30 May 2012, rugby union side London Welsh RFC played the second leg of the 2011–12 RFU Championship play–off final against Cornish Pirates at the Kassam Stadium. London Welsh won the match 29–20 in front of a crowd of 3,456. The victory gave them an overall aggregate win of 66–41.The stadium became London Welsh's home ground for the 2012–13 season in the English Premiership. London Welsh's promotion was initially rejected by the governing Rugby Football Union, but the decision was successfully appealed by the club. The move to the Kassam was a result of the Premiership's minimum capacity requirement of 10,000, which the side's former ground at Old Deer Park in Richmond did not meet. London Welsh played their opening fixture of the 2012–13 Aviva Premiership season against Leicester Tigers on 2 September 2012, losing by 38 points to 13, in front of a crowd of 6,850 people.Despite the club's relegation from the Premiership at the end of the 2012–13 season, it was announced in June 2013 that the ground share would continue for the following season. In June 2015, the club announced that they had left the Kassam Stadium, moving back to Old Deer Park for the 2015–16 season, despite having signed a three-year contract in 2014.
