=== North Stand ===

The North Stand was completed first (before the South Stand), which enabled Halifax Town to return to the Football League when it won the Conference in 1998. The South Stand was completed within the next year. The stand is usually where away fans are housed. In recent times the stand hasn't been used as Halifax Town's opponents don't tend to bring a large following of supporters. For rugby league the stand is usually open. It is a terraced stand.


=== South Stand ===

The South Stand is generally where the home fans stand. It was once the away stand.  The stand has a bar in its concourse and catering facilities are situated outside.


=== Skircoat West Stand ===

The stand used to be half-seating half-standing but became all-seater in 1998. It is the oldest part of the ground and is not the full length of the pitch. Like the North Stand it was built on the side of a slope and backs onto the main road.


=== East Stand ===
The East Stand is now the main stand at the Shay. 
In the past it has been the main problem at the Shay as when the Family Stand was demolished in 2000, construction on the new East Stand started but stopped when Halifax Town were relegated in 2002.
The stand remained in this state until late 2008 when Calderdale Council agreed to put money into completing the stand. The stand was redesigned by Sheffield-based architects Ward McHugh Associates prior to the commencement of works. 
Main structural work on the stand was completed in December 2009, it then needed to go through safety checks and to be furnished inside. 
28 March 2010; the new East Stand opened taking the overall ground capacity to over 10,000, as well as providing six executive boxes overlooking the pitch, which can accommodate up to 12 people per box and also new facilities as listed below.
