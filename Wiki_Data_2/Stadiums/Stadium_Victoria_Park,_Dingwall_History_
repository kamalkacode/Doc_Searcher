== History ==
Victoria Park has a greater capacity than the population of Dingwall, which was 5,491 at the 2011 census. However the County of Ross and Cromarty from which the club draws much of its support has a population of over 60,000. The largest crowd ever to watch a match at Victoria Park was reported as 8,000, for the Scottish Cup match between Ross County and Rangers in February 1966. The revenue from this match helped to fund construction of the Jail End terrace.Ross County played in the Highland League until 1994, when they were admitted to the Scottish Football League Third Division alongside Inverness Caledonian Thistle. Victoria Park then became the most northerly ground in the senior section of the Scottish football league system, until Elgin City were admitted in 2000.
Ross County gained promotion to the Scottish Premier League (SPL) by winning the 2011â€“12 Scottish First Division. The stadium was renovated in the spring and summer of 2012 to meet SPL criteria. This involved installing seats in the Jail End, constructing a new North Stand, installing undersoil heating and providing more car parking. Victoria Park was renamed the Global Energy Stadium, after the company founded by Ross County chairman Roy MacGregor, when the renovation was completed in July 2012.
