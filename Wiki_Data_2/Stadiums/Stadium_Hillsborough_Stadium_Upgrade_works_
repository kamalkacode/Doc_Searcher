== Upgrade works ==


=== 2017 ===
Sheffield Wednesday did not secure promotion to the Premier League in the 2015/16 season, and so some of the long-term upgrade plans have been delayed. However in July 2017 some upgrade and improvement works commenced with completion before the first league home game in August 2017:

Increase in the congregation area at the rear of the Kop
Installation of a new bar at the rear of the Kop
New printed banner over the Leppings Lane face of the West Stand
New fire suppression systems in all concourse Kiosk
LED Perimeter boardsDuring the 2015/6 season the club installed a completely new EPOS system on the concourses


=== Future plans ===
Sheffield Wednesday announced in the summer of 2009 plans for a Â£22 million upgrade of the stadium and an increase in capacity to 44,825 from the current 39,732 with no viewing restrictions. These plans were to be completed by 2013 and would bring the stadium up to FIFA standards for hosting World Cup matches.
For reference, the details of the plans are as follows:

Removing the current pillars that support the roof of the Kop and installing an 'iconic' roof structure
Adding a corner between North Stand and the Kop with a medium-sized round hole underneath the seats to let wind get onto the pitch
Adding a roof to the North-West Corner
Removing the pillars and roof from the West Stand and replacing the roof
Removing the present tier on the West Stand so that the inclination of the present day upper tier continues to pitch level
Adding a new tier above the present upper tier on the West Stand with a 'new specific learning zone' between the new upper tier and present upper tier
Renovation of the exterior appearance of the West Stand
Demolition of the mega-store and gymnasium behind the North Stand
The extension of the North Stand to create the 'biggest classroom in Europe' as well as 'enterprise zones' and 17 boxes
Improved layout of the stadium South Stand floor plan and stadium surroundings to comply with FIFA requirements
Improved parking and stadium access
Adding rainwater harvesting and solar cell technology
Demolition of the existing stadium control between the South Stand and West Stand and relocation to the corner between the Kop and South Stand
Adding TV screens to the corners of the roof between the Kop-North Stand and South Stand-West Stand
New bridge across the River Don for entry to West Stand, with turnstiles on the other side of the river
