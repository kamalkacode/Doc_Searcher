== Stadium structure ==

When first opened, Griffin Park had no terracing and banks surrounded the pitch, covered with ashes. A tiny stand was erected, which was initially refused a safety certificate.


=== Stands ===
Braemar Road Stand – A two-tiered all-seated stand located along the Braemar Road, with the lower tier being known as 'the Paddock'. The stand also houses the dressing rooms, supporters' bar and club offices. The stand's forecourt houses the club shop and ticket office. Until 2010, the dugouts were located in front of the stand.
New Road Stand – A single-tiered all-seated stand located along the New Road. It is currently known as the Bill Axbey Stand, as a tribute to the club's oldest-ever supporter. The away supporters' section was housed in the northwest corner of the stand until October 1991. Previously a terrace, the stand was converted to seating in the summer of 1996. The dugouts have been located in front of the stand since 2010 at the request of then-manager Andy Scott. The central camera position for TV broadcasts of games is located in a gantry suspended from the roof of the stand. The Family Section is located in blocks N506, N507 and N508.
Ealing Road Terrace – A single-tier terrace located at the Ealing Road end of the ground. Previously uncovered, the club had an application to build a roof turned down in 2004 and the terrace finally received a roof in 2007. Traditionally a home end, the terrace housed away supporters at various times throughout the 2000s.
Brook Road Stand – A two-tiered stand with seating on the upper level and terracing on the lower level, built in the mid-1980s to replace the Royal Oak Stand (Griffin Park's 'kop'). At varying times the stand has housed home supporters (1980s, 2001–2007) or away supporters (1980s, 2007–present) and because of its appearance is affectionately known as 'the Wendy House'. Until 2004, a vane display scoreboard was mounted on the stand's facade.


=== Floodlights ===
Brentford was one of the first clubs to recognise the potential of floodlit football and in 1954, a sum of £5,345 was spent on erecting perimeter lights the length of the Braemar Road and New Road stands. With the Football League banning competitive games under floodlights, a number of friendly matches were arranged to increase revenue, with one match against an International Managers XI attracting 21,600 spectators. By the time the Football League's ban on competitive floodlit football was lifted in February 1956, the club had received over £10,000 in gate receipts from the friendly matches. The original perimeter lights were replaced in August 1963 with pylons located at each corner of the ground, at a cost of £17,000. The current floodlight lamps on the pylons were purchased from West London neighbours Chelsea in 1983. Electronic scoreboards have been attached to two of the pylons since 2004. The floodlights were upgraded from 590 to 1000 lux during the 2015 off-season.
