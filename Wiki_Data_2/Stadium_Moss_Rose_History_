== History ==
The Moss Rose first hosted Football League action when Chester City played home games at the stadium between moving from Sealand Road to the Deva Stadium from 1990 to 1992. The first such match was a 2-1 win for Exeter City on 1 September 1990. Later in the month, Arsenal played at the Moss Rose in a Football League Cup tie, winning 1-0. Macclesfield were a non-league side at the time and fixtures were arranged so Chester were at home when Macclesfield were away and vice versa. The Moss Rose pitch was having to contend with more than 50 first-team matches a season from the two sides.
Despite hosting Football League matches in this period, Macclesfield were denied entry to the Football League in 1995 after winning the Football Conference after the stadium requirements were tightened (a reciprocal offer by Chester to allow Macclesfield to play at the Deva Stadium while the necessary improvements were made was also rejected by the league). Macclesfield were champions again two years later and the Moss Rose was now up to the required standards. The Silkmen beat Torquay United in their first home league match on 9 August 1997 and the Moss Rose continues to host professional matches today.
