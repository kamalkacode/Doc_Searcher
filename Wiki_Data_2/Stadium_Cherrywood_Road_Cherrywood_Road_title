The Rushmoor Community Stadium (commonly known as Cherrywood Road) is the ground of Farnborough F.C. and the former home of Farnborough Town F.C. before the club went out of business in 2007. It lies in the town of Farnborough, Hampshire. The capacity of the ground was 4,200, with 627 seats. Recent improvements to the ground in 2008 and the redevelopment of the Prospect Road End increased the capacity to 6,000. Up to the mid-1970s Farnborough Town F.C. had played at Queens Road but moved due to the lack of facilities. Cherrywood Road was newly built with the help of a local company Worldwide Carpets. The ground was formerly called The John Roberts Ground but the name is rarely used with fans simply referring to the stadium as Cherrywood Road. 
For a period in the early 2000s it was known as the Aimita Stadium after the company of chairman/manager Graham Westley. The fans were against the renaming of the stadium by Westley and the name reverted to Cherrywood Road following his departure in 2003. The ground was briefly called the Rushmoor Stadium at the beginning the 2010/11 season to entice the local council but confusion with the local Rushmoor Arena and the departure of chairman Simon Hollis resulted in a return, once again, to Cherrywood Road.
As of 2013, the stadium is known as Paddy Power Park, after a sponsorship deal was signed with the bookmaking firm Paddy Power.
