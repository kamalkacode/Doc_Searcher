== Future developments ==
In 2008, Swindon Town's owners released a 10-point plan after they took over the club in January. Outlining future plans for the County Ground. In this 10 point plan various upgrades to the current ground were noted. The club plans to replace all of the seats that are not red and white and replace them with red and white seas to unify the seating and make the stadium look more up to date. The club also plan to improve disabled access and improve the playing surface. The current owners of Swindon Town also hope to commence with a ground redevelopment at the County Ground site or new stadium for Swindon Town, hence the reasons for minor modifications until a new stadium becomes a reality.
Relocation was first proposed around the year 2000, but since then redevelopment appears to have been the preferred option.
In September 2009 Swindon Town announced that the County Ground would be redeveloped into a 25,000-seater stadium ready for the 2012-13 season. Had Bristol become a World Cup host city, it had been hoped that international Teams will use the County Ground as a training ground in 2018 or 2022. However, England's bid to host the World Cup failed in December 2010.
In January 2011, revised plans were announced, to expand the stadium capacity to 19,000 by rebuilding the town end to a 4,000 seater stand, putting a roof over the stratton bank, putting executive boxes in the Don Rogers stand, then finally refurbishing the Arkells stand with a technology park built behind for more income. It was also suggested that in the future, if needs be, the stadium could be increased to hold 25,000. This proposition was chosen due to the increased financial viability and sustainability for the future. The land which the county ground is on will also be bought in the process.
These plans, however, were delayed due to Swindon Town's relegation to League Two at the end of the 2010-11 season.
