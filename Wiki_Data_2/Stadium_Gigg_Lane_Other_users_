Manchester United and Bolton Wanderers have hosted reserve-team matches at the ground.
F.C. United of Manchester shared the ground from the 2005–06 season until 2014. They moved into their own ground for the 2015–16 season. F.C. United set a club record attendance of 6,731 when they played Brighton and Hove Albion in the FA Cup on 8 December 2010.
A couple of teams have moved their "home" games to the stadium, including Preston North End for a League Cup tie in 1994. Non-league sides Rossendale United and Radcliffe Borough moved home F.A. Cup ties to Gigg Lane against Bolton Wanderers (in 1971) and York City respectively.In 1996, the stadium was used as the filming location for the TV film based on the Hillsborough disaster of 1989, where 96 Liverpool fans died as a result of a crush on the stadium's terraces. Hillsborough was seen as an unsuitable location for the film, partly to avoid causing further distress to survivors and bereaved families, and partly because the appearance of Gigg Lane was more akin to the 1989 Hillsborough than the actual stadium was seven years after the tragedy due to redevelopment.The stadium has been used for many sports other than football, such as rugby league (Swinton Lions played at Gigg Lane between 1992 and 2002), cricket, baseball and lacrosse.
