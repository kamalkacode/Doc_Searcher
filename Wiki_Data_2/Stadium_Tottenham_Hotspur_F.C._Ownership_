Tottenham Hotspur F.C. became a limited company, The Tottenham Hotspur Football and Athletic Company Ltd, on 2 March 1898 so as to raise funds for the club and limit the personal liability of its members. 8,000 shares were issued at £1 each, although only 1,558 shares were taken up in the first year. Members of the Wale family, who had association with the club since the 1930s and were chairmen of Tottenham Hotspur F.C. in the 1960s and 1970s, were once the largest shareholder of the club. In the early 1980s, cost overruns in the construction of a new West Stand together with the cost of rebuilding the team in previous years led to financial difficulties for the club. In November 1982, Irving Scholar bought 25% of the club for £600,000, and together with Paul Bobroff gained control of the club. Scholar floated Tottenham Hotspur plc, which wholly owns the football club, on the London Stock Exchange in 1983, the first European sports club to be listed in a stock market. The share issue was successful with 3.8 million shares quickly sold. Ill-judged financial decisions led to accumulating debts, and in June 1991 Terry Venables teamed up with businessman Alan Sugar to buy the club, initially as equal partner with each investing £3.25 million. Sugar increased his stake to £8 million by December 1991 and became the dominant partner with effective control of the club. In May 1993, Venables was sacked from the board after a dispute.  By 2000, Sugar began to consider selling the club, and in February 2001, he sold the major part of his shareholding to ENIC International Ltd.Between 2001 and 2011 shares in Tottenham Hotspur F.C. were listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM index). The majority shareholder, ENIC International Ltd, is an investment company established by the British billionaire Joe Lewis. Daniel Levy, Lewis's partner at ENIC, is Executive Chairman of the club. They had acquired 29.9% after buying 27% share of the club for £22 million from Sugar in 1991. Shareholding by ENIC increased over the decade through the purchase of the remaining 12% holding of Alan Sugar in 2007 for £25m, and the 9.9% stake belonging to Stelios Haji-Ioannou through Hodram Inc in 2009. On 21 August 2009 the club reported that they had issued a further 30 million shares to fund the initial development costs of the new stadium project, and that 27.8 million of these new shares had been purchased by ENIC. The Annual Report for 2010 indicated that ENIC had acquired 76% of all Ordinary Shares and also held 97% of all convertible redeemable preference shares, equivalent to a holding of 85% of share capital. Following an announcement at the 2011 AGM, in January 2012 the club confirmed that they had been transferred into the private ownership of ENIC.
