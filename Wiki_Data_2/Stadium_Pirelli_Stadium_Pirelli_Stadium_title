Pirelli Stadium is an association football stadium on Princess Way in Burton upon Trent, East Staffordshire, England. It was built in 2005 and is the current home of Burton Albion F.C., replacing the club's old Eton Park home, also on Princess Way, which was demolished and developed into housing. The ground was built on the former site of the Pirelli UK Tyres Ltd Sports & Social Club, and having had the land donated to the club by Pirelli, in return for naming rights, the ground cost Â£7.2 million to build.
The ground was designed by architects Hadfield, Cawkwell and Davidson, and has served as the inspiration for numerous newer grounds, including Morecambe's Globe Arena, and the proposed Hayes & Yeading stadium. It gained its most recent safety certificate from Staffordshire County Council on 12 July 2010, having been subject to crowd trouble on 8 May 2010 at the hands of Grimsby Town fans following their relegation from Football League Two.The ground has seen minor capacity changes since its construction, and the current capacity stands at 6,912, with 2,034 being seated in the South (Main) Stand. The current record attendance for the stadium stands at 6,746 for an EFL Championship match against nearby Derby County.
