Haig Avenue now has a capacity of 6,008 but its record attendance is 20,010 for two matches played by Southport against Newcastle United in the fourth round of the FA Cup in 1932 and against Everton in a 1968 FA Cup tie. Since Southport lost Football League status in 1978, the ground has seldom operated at more than a quarter full, although nearly full houses were registered for key matches such as the 1998 F.A. Trophy semi-final against Slough Town, which Southport won to reach their first ever Wembley final, and their 2010 FA Cup third round home tie against Sheffield Wednesday.
The ground has a covered main stand on the north side of the ground (the entrance to it is from Haig Avenue, the road) called "the Grandstand". This is opposite an uncovered terrace on the south side, known as "the Popular Side". Behind the goals, the west (Scarisbrick) end is covered and this is where the majority of the home fans congregate. The west stand is called the "Jack Carr Stand", after a popular director at the club, and was named shortly after his death. The east (Blowick) end, used mainly by away team supporters, is open to the elements. The north and west sides of the ground back onto residential property and the uncovered south and east sides onto the playing fields of the nearby Meols Cop High School. The Haig Avenue road is a thoroughfare linking Scarisbrick New Road (A570) with Meols Cop Road and Norwood Road.There are limited car parking facilities and these are reserved for home, away and match officials. There is usually ample parking in local streets.
