St James' Park is a football stadium in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. It is the home of Premier League club Newcastle United F.C. With a seating capacity of 52,354 it is the seventh largest football stadium in England.St James' Park has been the home ground of Newcastle United since 1892 and has been used for football since 1880. Throughout its history, the desire for expansion has caused conflict with local residents and the local council. This has led to proposals to move at least twice in the late 1960s, and a controversial 1995 proposed move to nearby Leazes Park. Reluctance to move has led to the distinctive lop-sided appearance of the present-day stadium's asymmetrical stands.Besides club football, St James' Park has also been used for international football: it was used as a football venue for the 2012 Olympics, and also as a rugby venue for the 2015, 2016, 2017 & 2018 Rugby League Super League Magic Weekend and for the 2015 Rugby Union World Cup. In addition to professional football, the stadium has hosted charity football events and rock concerts, and been used as a set for film and reality television.
