Telephones
Pitcairn uses New Zealand's international calling code, +64. It is still on the manual telephone system.
Radio
There is no broadcast station. Marine band walkie-talkie radios are used to maintain contact among people in different areas of the island. Foreign stations can be picked up on shortwave radio.
Amateur radio
Callsign website QRZ.COM lists six amateur radio operators on the island, using the ITU prefix (assigned through the UK) of VP6. However, some of those operators have died, while others are no longer active. The last DX-pedition to Pitcairn took place in 2012. In 2008, a major DX-pedition visited Ducie Island.
Television
Pitcairn can receive a number of television channels but only has capacity to broadcast two to houses at any one time. The channels are currently switched on a regular basis.
Internet
There is one government-sponsored satellite internet connection, with networking provided to the inhabitants of the island. Pitcairn's country code top-level domain is .pn. Residents pay NZ$ 100 (about £50) for 2 GB of data per month, at a rate of 256 kbit/s. In 2012, a single 1Mbit/s link installed provided the islanders with an internet connection, the 1Mbit/s was shared across all families on the island. By December 2017, the British Government implemented a 4G LTE mobile network in Adamstown with shared speeds of 5 Mbit/s across all islanders.
