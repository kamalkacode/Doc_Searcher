== Geography ==

The country consists of two main islands, Saint Kitts and Nevis. The highest peak, at 1,156 metres (3,793 ft), is Mount Liamuiga on St. Kitts. The southernmost point is Dogwood Point on Nevis.
The islands are of volcanic origin, with large central peaks covered in tropical rainforest; the steeper slopes leading to these peaks are mostly uninhabited. The majority of the population on both islands lives closer to the sea where the terrain flattens out. There are numerous rivers descending from the mountains of both islands, which provide fresh water to the local population. St. Kitts also has one small lake, a salt pond.
