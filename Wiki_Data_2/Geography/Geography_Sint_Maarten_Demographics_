English is the day-to-day administrative language and language of communication in Sint Maarten, and the first language of the majority; the government uses Dutch when communicating with the Dutch government and formerly did so with the Netherlands Antilles government. Local signage uses both Dutch and English. The government continues to produce Dutch-language documents. There were English-medium and Dutch-medium schools on St. Maarten, and the Dutch government policy towards St. Maarten and other SSS islands promoted English medium education. As per the 2001 census there were far more Spanish speakers than Dutch speakers; each group was 14.8% and 4.2%, respectively. Thus, Sint Maarten is a polyglot society, they are simultaneous bilinguals in Dutch and English, and among them speak Spanish. Linguist Linda-Andrea Richardson stated in 1983 that Dutch was a "dead language" in Sint Maarten.Some residents, including Arubans and St. Martiners who lived in Aruba, speak Papiamento.
