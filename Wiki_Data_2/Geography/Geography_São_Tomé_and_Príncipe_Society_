=== Demographics ===

The first ever census was carried out in 2011 with the help of the National Statistic Institute (INE) of Cape Verde.The total population is estimated at 163,784 in 2010 by the government agency. Approximately 157,000 people live on São Tomé and 6,000 on Príncipe.
All are descended from people from different countries taken to the islands by the Portuguese from 1470 onwards. In the 1970s, there were two significant population movements—the exodus of most of the 4,000 Portuguese residents and the influx of several hundred São Tomé refugees from Angola.


=== Ethnic groups ===
Distinct ethnic groups on São Tomé and Príncipe include:

Mestiços, or mixed-blood, descendants of Portuguese colonists and African slaves brought to the islands during the early years of settlement from Benin, Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Angola (these people also are known as filhos da terra or "children of the land").
Angolares, reputedly descendants of Angolan slaves who survived a 1540 shipwreck and now earn their livelihood fishing.
Forros, descendants of freed slaves when slavery was abolished.
Serviçais, contract laborers from Angola, Mozambique, and Cape Verde, living temporarily on the islands.
Tongas, children of serviçais born on the islands.
Europeans, primarily Portuguese.
Asians, mostly Chinese, including Macanese people of mixed Portuguese and Chinese descent from Macau.


=== Languages ===

Portuguese is the official and the de facto national language of São Tomé and Príncipe, with about 98.4% speaking it in the country, a significant share of it as their native language, and it has been spoken in the islands since the end of the 15th century. Restructured variants of Portuguese or Portuguese creoles are also spoken: Forro, a creole language (36.2%), Cape Verdean Creole (8.5%), Angolar (6.6%) and Principense (1%). French (6.8%) and English (4.9%) are foreign languages taught in schools.


=== Religion ===
The majority of residents belong to the local branch of the Roman Catholic Church, which in turn retains close ties with the church in Portugal. There are also sizeable Protestant minorities of Seventh-day Adventists and other Evangelical Protestants. There is a small but growing Muslim population.


=== Health ===
There was a resurgence of malaria in the country in 2010, but the exact cause is unknown. Female life expectancy at birth was 65.1 years in between 2005 and 2010, and male life expectancy at 62.8 for the same time period. Healthy life expectancy at birth was at 64.7 years in 2011.A Cuban medical team of seven doctors, nurses and other health workers is working on the main island, with occasional visits to Príncipe.Government health expenditure per capita was at US$90.73 (current US$) in 2009.According to WHO, São Tomé and Príncipe is also home to the largest documented amount of iron-deficiency anemia amongst any country's population.


=== Education ===
Education in São Tomé and Príncipe is compulsory for four years. Primary school enrollment and attendance rates were unavailable for São Tomé and Príncipe as of 2001.The educational system has a shortage of classrooms, insufficiently trained and underpaid teachers, inadequate textbooks and materials, high rates of repetition, poor educational planning and management, and a lack of community involvement in school management. Domestic financing of the school system is lacking, leaving the system highly dependent on foreign financing.Tertiary institutions are the National Lyceum (São Tomé and Príncipe) and the University of São Tomé and Príncipe.
