== Demographics ==

Historical population figures are unknown. In 1862, the population was estimated at about 10,000. In 1960, the entire population was about 15,000. In the 2011 Census, the number of island residents was 53,158. Over two-thirds of the population live in the capital, Majuro and Ebeye, the secondary urban center, located in Kwajalein Atoll. This excludes many who have relocated elsewhere, primarily to the United States. The Compact of Free Association allows them to freely relocate to the United States and obtain work there. A large concentration of about 4,300 Marshall Islanders have relocated to Springdale, Arkansas, the largest population concentration of natives outside their island home.Most of the residents are Marshallese, who are of Micronesian origin and migrated from Asia several thousand years ago. A minority of Marshallese have some recent Asian ancestry, mainly Japanese. About one-half of the nation's population lives on Majuro, the capital, and Ebeye, a densely populated island. The outer islands are sparsely populated due to lack of employment opportunities and economic development. Life on the outer atolls is generally traditional.
The official languages of the Marshall Islands are English and Marshallese. Both languages are widely spoken.

There is also a small community of Ahmadiyya Muslims based in Majuro, with the first mosque opening in the capital in September 2012.


=== Health ===
A 2007–2008 study revealed that the rate of type 2 diabetes is among the highest in the world; 28% over the age of 15; 50% over 35. Approximately 75% of women, and 50% of men are overweight or obese.
This is mostly due to the adoption of an unhealthy diet and lack of exercise.
About 50% of all surgeries performed on the island are amputations due to complications from diabetes. There are no facilities for renal dialysis.According to a report by the BBC, life expectancy is 67 years for men and 71 years for women.
