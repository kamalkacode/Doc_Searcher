According to the South African Institute of Race Relations, the life expectancy in 2009 was 71 years for a white South African and 48 years for a black South African. The healthcare spending in the country is about 9% of GDP.About 84% of the population depends on the public healthcare system, which is beset with chronic human resource shortages and limited resources.About 20% of the population uses private healthcare. Only 16% of the population is covered by medical schemes. The rest pay for private care "out of pocket" or through hospital cash plans. The three dominant hospital groups, Mediclinic, Life Healthcare and Netcare, together control 75% of the private hospital market.South Africa is home to the third largest hospital in the world, the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital.


=== HIV/AIDS ===

According to the 2015 UNAIDS Report, South Africa has an estimated 7 million people living with HIV â€“ more than any other country in the world. A 2008 study revealed that HIV/AIDS infection in South Africa is distinctly divided along racial lines: 13.6% of blacks are HIV-positive, whereas only 0.3% of whites have the disease. Most deaths are experienced by economically active individuals, resulting in many AIDS orphans who in many cases depend on the state for care and financial support. It is estimated that there are 1,200,000 orphans in South Africa.The link between HIV, a virus spread primarily by sexual contact, and AIDS was long denied by President Thabo Mbeki and his health minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, who insisted that the many deaths in the country are due to malnutrition, and hence poverty, and not HIV. In 2007, in response to international pressure, the government made efforts to fight AIDS.After the 2009 General Elections, President Jacob Zuma appointed Dr Aaron Motsoaledi as the new minister and committed his government to increasing funding for and widening the scope of AIDS treatment, and by 2015, South Africa had made significant progress in HIV treatment, with the widespread availability of cheap and effective medication resulting in an increase in life expectancy from 52.1 years to 62.5 years.
