== Etymology ==
The name of the country comes from the river of the same name. There is no consensus regarding the derivation or meaning of Paraguay, although many versions are similar and all of them in Paraguayan Guarani. The most widely believed is that it comes from Paraguay (compound of para 'sea', and the suffix -gua 'native to, coming from') and y (water, river), which can mean either "water that comes from the sea" or "the water of the people from the sea". Even though most believe that it means the first, the second meaning is more possible from a linguistic point of view.
Friar Antonio Ruiz de Montoya (1585–1652) wrote in his 1639 work Tesoro de la Lengua guaraní (Thesaurus of the Guarani Language) that it was a compound of Paraguay (feather crown) and y, thus meaning "river of crowns" or "the river where men live and are ornate with crowns of various feathers"
The Spanish officer and scientist Félix de Azara (1746–1821) suggested two derivations: the Payaguás (Pajagua y, "river of Payaguás"), referring to the indigenous tribe who lived along the river, or a great cacique named Paraguáio or Paraguájo.
Although originally the word in Guarani was Paraguay, the country is called Paraguái and pronounced the same as in Spanish, with the close front unrounded vowel [i] instead of [ɨ]. The word Paraguay is just used to refer to the river and the capital city of Asunción.
