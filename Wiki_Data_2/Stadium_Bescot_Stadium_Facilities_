The stadium is situated less than a mile from junction 9 of the M6 motorway, has a mainline railway station within easy walking distance and parking spaces for around 1,200 vehicles.
Bescot Stadium has two large conferencing suites – the Bonser Suite and the Stadium Suite. The Bonser Suite adjoins the rear of the Main Stand (formerly the H. L. Fellows Stand), while the Stadium Suite is underneath the upper tier of the northern most stand (currently the Tile Choice Stand). Both suites host conferences, cabaret evenings, concerts and events.
In addition to this, there are five further bars within the Stadium – the Swifts and Priory Lounges to the rear of the Main Stand,  the Bescot Bar beneath the lower tier of the Tile Choice Stand, a bar beneath the away supporters stand, and one beneath the Family Stand. There are food and beverage kiosks in all four corners of the ground, whilst the Bonser Suite doubles as a restaurant on match days.
In 2009, the club erected a large advertising hoarding to the south of the southern most stand, facing the M6 motorway.
