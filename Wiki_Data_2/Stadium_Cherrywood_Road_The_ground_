== The ground ==
On one side of the ground is the Main Stand, named in 2009 the Charles Mortimore Stand after the long-serving club president. This stand comprises covered seating and was extended and improved during summer 2008. The total length of the stand is approximately half that of the pitch and on either side there are small terraced areas. Opposite is another covered stand which runs the length of the pitch, this was previously a covered terrace but was converted to seating during the 2009 close season.  This stand does not have an official name, however, many fans refer to it as the SWAN, an acronym which stands for Stand Without A Name . This additional work has brought the amount of seating at the stadium up to 950.  The Moor Road End of the ground is terraced with a covering added to the rear section in summer 2008. The terracing was rebuilt during the 08/09 season. 
The stadium's main colour was red until the reformation of Farnborough F.C., at which time it was painted yellow and blue to fit with the club's colours.
Away fans of visiting teams to the ground are usually not segregated, although for big matches away fans are usually housed at the Moor Road End. This is especially apparent when the club are playing local rivals Aldershot Town F.C. and Woking F.C..
