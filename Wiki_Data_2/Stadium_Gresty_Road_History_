== History ==
Crewe had initially played at the Alexandra Recreation Ground, also on Gresty Road and located just to the north of current site. After leaving the ground towards the end of the 1895â€“96 season the club played at a variety of venues, including in nearby Sandbach, before moving to the original Gresty Road ground in 1897.In 1906 the ground was demolished to make way for the construction of new railway lines, and a new Gresty Road ground was built directly to the west of the site. The new ground initially had a stand on each touchline, one of which had been moved from the first Gresty Road ground, and some embankments around the remainder of the pitch. After a fire, a new Main Stand was built on the south side of the ground in 1932. The record attendance of 20,000 was set on 30 January 1960 for an FA Cup match against Tottenham.In the 1990s Gresty Road was rebuilt, with all-seater stands constructed on all four sides of the ground.On 31 May 2015, the ground held an international friendly match between Northern Ireland and Qatar.
