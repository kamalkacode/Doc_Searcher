== Stands and facilities ==

The ground's four stands are: HTM Stand (Main), Karen Child Stand (South), Rubicon Print Stand (North) and Spencers Solicitors Community Stand (East). Unlike Saltergate, Chesterfield's old home, all stands enjoy unrestricted views.


=== VanYard Stand (West Stand) ===
The Main (West) stand has a curved roof line and a capacity of 3,144 seats with glazed windshields on either side and executive facilities at the rear. The stand includes conference rooms and banqueting rooms, including the Leengate Legends Lounge, and is where the majority of the club's non-footballing revenue is generated. The stand is sponsored by VanYard.


=== Karen Child Stand (South Stand) ===
Located behind the goal on the south side of the stadium, this stand is regarded as similar to the former Saltergate Kop in being the area where the main atmosphere is created by home supporters. Its capacity is 2,064 seats. The stand is sponsored by supporter Karen Child-Smith who won the National Lottery in 2007.


=== Rubicon Print Stand (North Stand) ===
The North Stand is almost identical to the South stand; the only difference is the North stand has only one disabled gantry while the South stand has two. Away supporters are primarily housed in this stand, where up to 2,088 can be seated. At the time the ground opened, the North Stand was called the 'Printability Stand'.


=== Spencers Solicitors Stand (East Stand) ===
Like the Main Stand, the East Stand has a curved roof line but with no executive facilities at the rear. It includes a multi-purpose sports and community room, sports injury clinic, meeting rooms, a gym and healthy living resource for all ages, a wave pool for rehabilitation, heritage room, classroom resource centre for local education, a soft play area for youngsters, and a cafeteria. Additional space for away fans may be provided in this stand as demand requires. Its capacity is 3,208 seats. (At the time the ground opened, the East Stand was called the 'Midlands Co-operative Community Stand').
All four stands encompass concourse facilities under the stand, including on-tap beverages and multiple television screens showing the game in progress, and Sky sports channels before and after the game.


=== HUB stand ===
On the exterior of the East Stand is a Â£1.7m community facility called 'the HUB'. This two story building was opened in September 2013 by the Chesterfield F.C. Community Trust. The HUB includes a cafe, 'Chester's Den', a playcentre, a gym, a therapy pool, a multi-use sports hall and classrooms. The facility also houses the offices of the Trust as well as other tenants and a martial arts dojo.


=== Chesterfield FC Memorial Garden ===
A memorial garden was opened in September 2014. Built by the Supporters' Club and now maintained by the Chesterfield F.C. Community Trust, the Garden is adjacent to the HUB. The Garden is intended as a memorial to fans and players of Chesterfield F.C. It also includes a war memorial recognising the seventeen football club players and officials who died in the wars of the 20th century.
