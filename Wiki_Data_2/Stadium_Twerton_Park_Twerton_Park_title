Twerton Park is a football stadium in the Twerton suburb of Bath, England.  It is currently used for football matches and is the home ground of Bath City. From 1986 to 1996 Bristol Rovers played there following their departure from Eastville. The stadium has a capacity of 8,840 people, with 1,066 seats.
The ground was opened on 26 June 1909 as Innox Park on land that had been donated by Thomas Carr. The opening ceremony involved a parade of scholars, the singing of hymns and a speech by the chairman of the parish council.Twerton Park became Bath City's ground in 1932.  A record attendance of 18,020 was recorded in 1960 versus Brighton & Hove Albion. The ground has also hosted Team Bath, who were a full-time professional team playing in the Conference South until their resignation at the end of the 2008–09 season.
At the end of the 2011–12 season the club offered the naming rights to Twerton Park for just £50. The offer drew 167 entries from as far afield as the US, Australia, Norway and Singapore which raised £3,850 for the club. Businesses made up 58 of the entries with only a handful of the remaining personalised entries being deemed unsuitable. The winning entry drawn at random was The Mayday Trust, a charitable organisation that helps to rehome vulnerable people.Talks have been held in the past between Bath Rugby and Bath City about sharing a ground, as the former team wish to move away from their home ground Recreation Ground, although nothing has amounted from this. Following the resignation of Chairman Manda Rigby, she claimed that the club needed to move away from Twerton Park to "sustain their finances".
