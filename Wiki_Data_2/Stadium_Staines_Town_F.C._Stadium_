Wheatsheaf Park is the home of the Staines Town Football Club  Wheatsheaf Park, It is situated in Wheatsheaf Lane, Staines-upon-Thames, Middlesex, TW18 2PD. It has been the home of the club since it was purchased in 1951. Like many football stadia, it has changed greatly over time; the most recent of these changes was the development of the main stand in the Wheatsheaf Lane End. Planning permission for this was granted by Spelthorne Council in March 2000, and Staines Town returned to the revamped ground on 22 February 2003. The club now boasts a brand new sports bar with Sky Sports football each week and refurbished changing rooms. Wheatsheaf Park is one of the most developed stadiums in its league.
Wheatsheaf Park has a total capacity of 3,009, with 300 seated and 800 in covered terrace. The record league attendance for a match at Wheatsheaf Park was 2,285 vs AFC Wimbledon in 2006. However, one year later Staines had an F.A Cup match against Stockport County and the attendance just crept over the 2,860 mark, setting the club's overall attendance record.
Wheatsheaf Park is also the current home stadium of Chelsea Ladies Football Club. In 2015 the ground received its UEFA Stadium Category 1 approval and hosted Chelsea L.F.C home fixtures in the UEFA Women's Champions League.
