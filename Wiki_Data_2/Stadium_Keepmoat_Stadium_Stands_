=== West Stand ===
This is the main match-day reception area with the stand sponsored by Estate.com.


=== South Stand ===
The South Stand, popularly known as the Black Bank, is sponsored by Polypipe. For Doncaster Rovers matches this is the stand that houses the Black Bank (the Ultras group of Doncaster Rovers supporters) and is decorated with flags and banners on match days, widely known for creating a fantastic atmosphere.


=== North Stand ===
The North Stand is sponsored by Corsan. The North Stand area closest to the East Stand is the usual location of visiting fans. Depending on the numbers of visitors, the availability of seats in this area are expanded westwards to meet demand.


=== Capacity ===
The all-seater stadium holds 15,231 spectators, 5,000 more than Belle Vue, with improved legroom and disabled access. Amongst the facilities in the new stadium is a new fans' bar, created to ensure fans have a place where they can enjoy pre-match drinks.
The pitch itself incorporates a system of synthetic fibres interwoven with natural grass. This helps to maintain the pitch's integrity and prevents the playing surface from deteriorating throughout the course of the season. The pitch however does not have an under-soil heating system in-place, despite being a modern construction. This has resulted in the postponement of a match within the first year of full operation.
