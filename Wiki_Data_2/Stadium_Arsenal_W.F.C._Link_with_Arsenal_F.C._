== Link with Arsenal F.C. ==
The women's side has the full backing and support of Arsenal Football Club. David Dein, former vice-chairman of Arsenal F.C., held the position of club President until he left the club on 18 April 2007, and was replaced by Keith Edelman, Arsenal's managing director, until his departure from the club on 1 May 2008. Ivan Gazidis, the chief executive of English Premier League club Arsenal Football Club, is currently the Chairman of Arsenal Women.
A number of the playing staff are employed by Arsenal to develop and co-ordinate the women's teams and club Academy. Ties between the two are close; sponsorship by Emirates and Puma (and Nike before that) is shared, and the women's club played on occasion at Arsenal's home stadium (Highbury until 2005–06 and Emirates Stadium since then).
Over the years, the women's team has been lauded by and done promotional work with counterparts from the men's team such as Tony Adams and Patrick Vieira. Ahead of a 2008 North London men's derby against Tottenham Hotspur, Cesc Fàbregas (then Arsenal's men's captain) told Loaded that he didn't believe that Arsenal Women would lose to the Tottenham men, saying, "They would do really well. I'm sure they would get a point!"
