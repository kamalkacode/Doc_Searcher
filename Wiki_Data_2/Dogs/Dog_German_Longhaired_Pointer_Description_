== Description ==


=== Appearance ===
The GLP should be muscular, elegant, and athletic. It should not be bulky or cumbersome, and it should be able to move with great speed and freedom. It has moderate bone, but has substance, and must never look frail or weak.  Like all German pointers, they have webbed feet. Puppies in their early years must be monitored for aggression.


==== Coat and color ====
The coat is medium length, about 3 to 5 cm (1.2 to 2.0 in) long on the body, with the feathering somewhat longer. The coat is slightly wavy, but must not be curly. It is not silky or soft, but rather firm and shiny. It always has a double coat, with the undercoat being quite dense, but not so profuse as to make the guard hairs stand out from the body. The color is solid brown with white permitted on the chest, paws, and down the top of the muzzle, or dark brown roan, with large patches of solid brown, especially on the head, ears, back, and base of the tail.


==== Size ====
The GLP is between 60–70 cm (24–28 in) at the withers for males, and 58–66 cm (23–26 in) for females. It weighs approximately 30 kilograms (66 lb).


==== Gait ====
The strides should be long and free, with strong drive from the hindquarters, and good reach from the front.


=== Temperament ===
GLPs are a kind, gentle, friendly, and intelligent breed. They are very affectionate, and may experience separation anxiety. They only make good pets when properly exercised, as they need a "job" to do, and do not adapt well to a sedentary life. The GLP is an excellent family pet, as it enjoys playing with children. It is very sociable with dogs.
