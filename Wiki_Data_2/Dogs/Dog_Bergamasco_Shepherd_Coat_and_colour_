== Coat and colour ==
The breed's most distinctive feature is the unusual felted coat, a normal and healthy characteristic of the breed. The coat is characterized by three types of hair: a fine, dense, oily undercoat, long harsher hairs similar to a goat's and a top woolly outer-coat. The three types of hair weave together as the dog gets older to form flat mats or flocks. The mats start from the spine and go down the flanks, growing every year to reach the ground. The color can be solid gray or gradations of gray (including merle) up to and including solid black, provided it is not shiny or lustrous. Color also includes shadings  only of isabella and fawn at the lower part of flocks (as a result of discoloration of old hair, not as a base color).The Eastern European breeds, the Komondor and Mioritic Shepherd, have a single coat consisting of relatively little guard hair (also referred to as "goat hair"), but mainly curly down hair as an adaptation to that environment. The Western European breeds, such as the Briard and the Spanish Water Dog, also have a single coat, however, it consists mainly of guard hair. The Alpine region geographically between them, home of the Bergamasco shepherd, appears to form a bridge between these two groups. The Bergamasco shepherd forms flocks which consist of both types of hair are present in almost equal proportions, although straighter and differently distributed.The Bergamasco's coat is considered to be non-shedding. The Bergamasco shepherd's coat does not cord (cording is the twisting of hairs together to create a spiral strand), like the Komondor. The Bergamasco coat is very different, in that the strands of hair weave together creating flat layers of hair (called flocks). A flock is a tuft or lock of wool or hair. Each flock of hair ranges in width anywhere from 1Â½ to 3 inches wide.
