=== Appearance ===

According to the FCI breed standard, the most important aspect of its appearance is its hairlessness. The dog may have short hair on top of its head, on its feet, and on the tip of its tail. In Peru, breeders tend to prefer completely hairless dogs. The full-coated variety is disqualified from conformation showing.
The color of skin can be chocolate-brown, elephant grey, copper, or mottled. They can be totally one color or one color with tongue pink spots. Albinism is not allowed. The eye color is linked to the skin color. It is always brown, but dogs with light colors can have clearer eyes than darker-skinned dogs.
Peruvian Hairless Dogs vary in size :

Small 25 – 40 cm (10 – 16 inches)
Medium 40 – 50 cm (16 – 20 inches)
Large 50 – 65 cm (20 – 26 inches)Weight is also varied according to size :

Small  4 – 8 kg (9 – 18 lbs)
Medium  8 – 12 kg (18 – 26 lbs)
Large  12 – 25 kg (26 – 55 lbs)The dogs should be slim and elegant, with the impression of force and harmony, without being coarse.
The ears should be candle-flame shaped and erect with the possibility to lay flat.
Proportions of height (at withers) to length (withers to base of tail) are 1:1.
