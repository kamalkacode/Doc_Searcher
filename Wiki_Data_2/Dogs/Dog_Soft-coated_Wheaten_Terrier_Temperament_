== Temperament ==

The Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier is an energetic and playful dog.  It requires patience and consistent positive training. Harsh methods will often result in fear and/or aggression.  A positive, even-handed approach works best with this intelligent yet headstrong terrier.  It is an enthusiastic greeter, and will often jump up to lick a person's face, commonly referred to as the "Wheaten greetin".
Wheatens are considered less scrappy than other terriers, but they can be hyper and more active than many other breeds. For this reason these dogs do best when they are exercised regularly. They are cool weather dogs and can become easily overheated in hot weather. If socialised with cats and puppies, they may get along fine with them; if not, care should be taken in introducing them to cats, as the breed has a very strong "prey drive" because of its vermin-hunting origin. Wheatens are extremely friendly and loving pets, and get along well with other dogs if properly socialised. Wheatens are very protective of their families and, although they may bark in alert at strangers, they rarely get aggressive. Many Wheaten owners thus say they make great watch dogs, but poor guard dogs. Wheatens are a great dog for children and are generally friendly towards them.
