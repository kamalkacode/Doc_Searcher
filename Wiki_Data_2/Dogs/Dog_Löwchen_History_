The breed is traceable to as far back as 1442. They are found in many old paintings, tapestries, engravings, drawings and in literature. It is an old breed type, found in many countries as far back as the sixteenth century. The little 'lion dog' is seen in many art pieces featuring dogs as far back as the sixteenth century, but it is unclear whether these were all dogs like the Löwchen, or simply small dogs of the Bichon type that were trimmed in a lion cut. Although this dog may be related to the Bichon Frise, the Löwchen's history remains obscure.
The Löwchen has a history as a companion dog to the wealthy and elite. It is possible to trace the modern history of the breed to late 19th-century enthusiasts in what are now Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. It is thought the breed's ancestors were dogs that were brought in by travelers from the far eastern lands of Tibet and mingled with local dogs such as Spitz and terrier-type dogs. Occasionally a genetic throw-back is found. Madame Bennerts started a breeding program in 1944, later with the help of veterinarian Dr Rickert.Löwchen were imported into Britain in 1968 and the breed was accorded Kennel Club (UK) recognition in 1971.  The Löwchen would finally make an appearance in America in 1971, by way of England.  At this time, the Lowchen was still known as the “Lion Dog”.  Also in 1971, The Löwchen Club of America (LCA) was formed and the breed’s name was officially changed to “Löwchen”.
