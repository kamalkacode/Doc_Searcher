Lagotto live roughly 16 years. Some health issues, especially neurological disorders are associated with this breed; however, these are mostly attributable to poor breeding.  Genetically testing prior to breeding is necessary to avoid the most common diseases in the breed. 
Issues include:

Hip dysplasia OFA scores, Penn Hip, Breeder has GD Hip Lineage
Benign Juvenile Epilepsy Look for BJE +/-. You do not want to breed two carriers  NO +/+
Cerebral Anomaly. Specifically Cerebral Ataxia.  Good Breeders breed clear.
Lagotto Storage Diseases (LSD) You do not want to breed two carriers.A new neurodegenerative disorder, called "Neuroaxonal Dystrophy", that was originally identified in Spanish Water Dogs has been identified in the breed in 2016. It is not known yet whether it is related to the disorders already associated with the Lagotto Romagnolo. https://os.genoscoper.com/crm/disorders/323_TECPR2_SWD/os/323_TECPR2_SWD.pdf
Lagotto puppies are crucial in research regarding epilepsy. In July 2011, researchers in Finland reported the discovery of a mutation in a gene called Lgi2 that may be a new candidate gene for human benign childhood epilepsy. Lgi2 is the first gene that can be linked directly to the remission that carriers experience after the age of ten. Lagotto breeders are now using genetic tests to screen for the mutation.
