In its original habitat, the hortaya borzaya is still purely a hunting sight hound. It is used on all game living in the steppe, especially for hunting hares, foxes, wolves and Saiga antelopes. It is extremely enduring, capable of working from early morning to late evening. Up to 8â€“10 runs on game in a day (including tracking prey together with the hunter across large distances) is a perfectly feasible workload. Unlike the Whippet or Greyhound, the hortaya is not a short distance sprinter. Game is usually chased for distances up to 4 km (2.5 mi) on the open steppe, and a hortaya can repeat such runs after only a short rest. Unlike most sight hounds, the hortaya does not hunt using sight alone; it often will track game it has lost sight of using its well-developed sense of smell.

Hortaya hunt singly on smaller game, or as pairs and larger groups on wolves, antelopes and deer. Small game is hunted and killed immediately, larger game is cornered and held in place for the hunter. The hortaya has a "soft mouth" like the Retriever breeds. After a quick kill, the game must not be rent as native hunters also use the furs. In the CIS hunting sight hounds are regularly tested, judged and graded in so-called "hunt trials".
The first hortaya have recently been officially exported with full breeding papers to European countries, e.g. Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany (2004), Finland and Switzerland. In 2005, the first hortaya was also exported to the United States. Some of these dogs participate in racing and coursing, partly out of competition due to the lack of international FCI recognition. Hortaya owned by European owners have shown an aptitude for Agility, Breitensport and have proven to be excellent trail companions for horseback riders. The first registered litter outside of the hortaya's historical habitat was born in Europe in 2006.
