== Description ==


=== Appearance ===
These terriers are one of the smallest working terriers 11–12 pounds (5.0–5.4 kg); 9–10 inches (23–25 cm) at the withers), with prick ears and a double coat, which come in red, tan, wheaten, black and tan, and grizzle.


=== Temperament ===
These small but hardy dogs can be courageous, intelligent and affectionate.  They can be assertive but it is not typical for them to be aggressive, quarrelsome or shy. They are energetic and thrive on an active life. They are also quite hungry all the time and will eat anything edible. They are eager to please but have definite minds of their own.  They are sensitive to scolding but 100% Terrier.  They should not usually be kept outside or in a kennel setting because they enjoy the companionship of their owners.  Norwich are not given to unnecessary barking, but they will warn of a stranger approaching.  Once they realize that there is no threat, they can become immediate friends.  Norwich are generally good with children, and if introduced to other household pets as a puppy they generally co-habit peacefully, though caution should be observed around rodent pets as they may be mistaken for prey.
