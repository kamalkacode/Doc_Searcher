Since ancient times it was used as shepherd dog for all cattle, even bird, and as a guard and defense in the houses of possession. While the timing of its arrival is unknown, some assumptions suggest that came either with the conquest of King James I of Aragon or shortly thereafter, and over the centuries the Majorcan shepherds and foravilers conferred it very own and distinct features not only from other islanders dogs, but also its neighbors around the Mediterranean.
In the 1970s was begun its selection and controlled breeding, and already in 1980 was drafted the standard to determine the characteristics and to have a valid reference to both the valuation and advice for reproduction, billboards carried out by the Club of "Ca de Bestiar" and that has been a cornerstone for its recovery. This racial prototype was accepted by the RSCPFRCE (Royal Central Society for the Promotion of Dog Breeds of Spain) and also recognized by the top world body: the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) on 13 September, 1982 with num. 321 classifying it as Group 1.
