=== Hunting ===
McDuffie sought out and bred Old Time Farm Shepherds for their hunting and treeing ability. He used his dogs to hunt raccoon, squirrel, and opossum.  McDuffie was adamant that the working traits in this breed be maintained and that selection must continue in the same manner as it had for generations or the breed would change.


=== Farm work ===
Old Time Farm Shepherds are often employed as multi-purpose dogs on small farms. As the descendants of the old working Scotch Collies they possess all the instinct and ability of their forebears, including herding, guardian and pest control. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Old Time Farm Shepherds that exhibit basic herding instincts can also be trained to compete in farm dog trials. McDuffie was adamant that selection by herding trials would not result in the same breed of dog.Old-Time Farm Shepherds have a specialized motivation; they often move livestock out of a sense of rules and routine, and vary their working strategies to suit the situation. They are easy to train to leave the livestock alone unless the stock are not where they belong.
