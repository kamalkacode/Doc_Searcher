The Russian Spaniel is a small, sturdy dog with a short, tight, silky coat with feathering on the ears and legs. Colors can vary greatly, and can include solid colors without white markings, piebald, speckled, black and tan, and combinations. The head and ears are also usually dark.
The Russian Spaniel resembles the English Cocker Spaniel, with a body similar to the field lines of that breed though with the longer ears of the show line. The body of the Russian Spaniel tends to be longer than that of the English Cocker however, and the breed has only one line rather than being split into separate specific show and field lines of the same breed.Both the male and females of the breed weigh on average 28–40 lb (13–18 kg) and are around 15–17 inches (38–43 cm) at the withers. This makes them similar in size or a little larger than the English Cocker Spaniel which weighs approximately 13–14.5 kg (29–32 lb) and is on average between 15.5 and 16 inches (39 and 41 cm) with the females being a little smaller at 15–15.5 inches (38–39 cm).Bred primarily as hunting dogs, their goal is to find the bird, send it into the air and then to retrieve it on command after the hunter has shot the quarry. The Russian Spaniel is suited for hunting in marshland, fields, woodland, for birds as well as rabbits and other small game. The breed is also popular in their native Russia as their small size makes them suitable to be kept in busy cities, and easily transported to hunting sites.
