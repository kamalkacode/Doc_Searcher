During the period after World War II, Russia needed thousands of guard dogs due to the rising crime . A breed of dog that could adapt to a very low temperature −30 – −40 °C (−22 – −40 °F), snowy environment during winter and to be able to guard nearly everything that was owned by the government, such as warehouses, railroads, labor camps and infrastructure. That was the reason why they started an immense project led by Gen Medvedev. It began in 1946 and lasted a year at the Central School Of Military Kynology, a department of USSR Ministry of Defense. After many years of experiments of crossbreeding purebred dogs, Moscow Watchdog was one of the most successful breeds from Caucasian Ovtcharka and St. Bernard. It provides the mental and physical aspect that they desired.In 1986, the first few Moscow watchdogs were brought to Hungary for breeders to help popularize the breed. Future growth was guaranteed by devoted breeders and also the breed owner, Club Karakán. In addition, dozens of breeders from former Soviet states had also work with the breed to ensure their existence for the future. At the time, around 500 Moscow Watchdogs could be found in Hungary.The breed standard was first published in 1985 when it received "official status" in the Soviet Union.  In 1992, it was approved by the Federation of the Dog Breeders of Russia and in 1997 the Department of Animal Breeding and Pedigree of The Ministry of Agriculture of Russia. The standard was also approved by the Russian Kennel Club in 1997.
The Russian Kennel Club is working with the International Kennel Federation (FCI) to gain official recognition.  Currently, the Moscow Watchdog is considered by the FCI as part of the 2nd group Molosser.  In FCI sanctioned dog shows, they are shown in what is referred to as a "Special Show."  Inside Russia, they are widely shown and a recognized breed.
