== Physical characteristics and body conformation ==


=== Coat ===
The breed occurs in three different coat varieties, all with an undercoat: a) relatively short, hard and flat, b) semi-long, profuse and harsh and c) a semi-long, hard, wire coat with some facial furnishings. The wire-haired variety is extremely rare. The coat must never be thin, sparse, soft and silky or lack a protective and insulating undercoat as the breed is a small utility dog that should be able to thrive outdoors as well as inside. Winters in the mountains of northern Greece can be quite harsh in particular, and the summers can be very hot, so a good coat quality is essential. The coat is easy to groom and inherently easy to keep clean by a caretaker. This is in part because Alopecis dogs are very clean by their nature and often groom themselves meticulously. The breed does not seem to attract as many external parasites as others.


=== Colour ===
All colours and combinations of colours are acceptable apart from total depigmentation (albinism). Typical colours include pure white, black or brown, as well as any bicolour combination of them: black and white, white with black or brown patches, black with white markings, brown with tan markings.


=== Size ===
Sizes range from 20 to 30 centimetres (7.9 to 11.8 in) at the withers and weigh between 3.5 to 7.5 kilograms (7.7 to 16.5 lb). Unlike most other small dog breeds, its size is due to insular dwarfism rather than selective breeding.
