=== Appearance ===

Mudi usually weigh 18 to 29 pounds (8.2 to 13.2 kg) and stand 15 to 19 inches (38 to 48 cm) high at the withers. The coat is medium wavy or curly, with short hair on the face and legs. The accepted colors are black (fekete), brown (barna), white (fehér), Fawn (fakó), Ash (hamvas), and Cifra (marbling of black and gray.) Mudis are born with various lengths of tails from bobtails to long full length tails. Dogs born with short or natural bobtail will be indicated on the FCI pedigree as docking is prohibited.


=== Temperament ===
The Mudi is a versatile farm dog that can hunt, exterminate rodents, and act as a capable herding dog and flock guardian. They are great for alerting and protecting their home and family. They have a high pitched bark and can be very loud. There are three herding dogs native to Hungary: the Puli, Pumi and Mudi, all having similar characteristics. The Mudi is a clever, keen, active dog who becomes very attached to its owner and family. The Mudi may be aloof with strangers and early socialization is recommended.


=== Exercise and activities ===
The Mudi is a very active breed. They need to be taken on a daily, long, brisk walks or jogs. In addition, they will benefit from a large safe area where they can run free. They need a lot of running and other exercises to be in good condition. They love to play and will excel in all kinds of dog sports such as Frisbee. The Mudi can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, Rally obedience, Schutzhund, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Mudi that exhibit basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.


=== Health problems ===
The Mudi is a generally healthy breed. Some health problems that have been seen in the Mudi include, hip dysplasia, epilepsy, cataracts, elbow dysplasia and patellar luxation. 


=== Living conditions ===
The Mudi can live in an apartment if it is sufficiently exercised. However, they need space to run and play and are more suited to a larger space. They are moderately active indoors and will do best with at least a large yard. This breed can live outdoors.


=== Life expectancy ===
About 13–14 years.  Although, two Mudis in Canada lived to 17.5 years of age.


=== Grooming ===
With its short coat, the Mudi is generally easy to groom. The Mudi's coat sheds dirt and hair, however, does not require frequent bathing. A weekly brushing is sufficient and their coat does not need trimming. The Mudi sheds in the spring and does not fully regain his coat until the end of summer. Their nails should be cut every few weeks as needed, along with basic care.
