== Appearance ==
Both breeds of Braque français are medium to large sized dogs with long legs and long drop ears. The coat is short, and chestnut brown or white speckled with brown in colour, often with one or more large brown spots. The head is usually brown.  The Gascogne is about 10 centimetres (3.9 in) taller at the withers than the Pyrenean.


=== Differences ===
The Braque français, type Pyrénées dogs are 47–58 centimetres (19–23 in) at the withers, females slightly smaller), giving the impression of "a German shorthaired pointer shrunk down to Brittany size". The larger Braque français, type Gascogne dogs are 58–69 centimetres (23–27 in) (females smaller)
The coat of the Gascogne is thick, while that of the Pyrénées is described as "finer and shorter" than the Gascogne. The Pyrénées is usually more mottled brown on the body.
The head of the Pyrénées is slightly broader, and the ears are not as long. On the Gascogne, if the ears are pulled forward, they will reach the tip of the nose. The Gascogne has slightly pendulous lips, making the muzzle appear square; the Pyrénées muzzle looks more narrow.Faults (elements of appearance that indicate that the dog should not be bred) in both breeds include no tail (anury), split nose or depigmented nose, syndactyly (toes grown together), surplus toes, or absence of toes.
