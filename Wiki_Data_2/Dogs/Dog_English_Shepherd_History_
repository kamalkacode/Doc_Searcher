Originating in northern England and Scotland, these dogs came with the first settlers to reach the American colonies. American farmers appreciated this versatile breed and used dogs to protect their farms and livestock. The English Shepherd and various other collies were also referred to as Scotch Collie's during the 18th and 19th centuries but the term "Scotch Collie" fell out of favor during the 20th century. Quoting from Leon F. Whitney early in the 20th century ("How to Breed Dogs", 1937, no ISBN) "It is known variously as the farm shepherd, the barnyard collie, the old fashioned shepherd, the cow dog, the English Shepherd, and other colloquial names. And while I doubt there is a more alert, trustworthy, or American dog, still no breed specialty clubs have organized to push it. It is the ordinary shepherd that one sees on farm after farm throughout the country." (Despite the publication date of 1937 given here English Shepherds were registered as a breed before that time through UKC (1927) and probably the defunct Southeastern Kennel Club before then.)
UKC apparently had another registration going on for a type of "farm shepherd" that was separate from the English Shepherd. Many times the names were confused but at other times they were distinguished as different breeds. All of these names as well as Farm Collie were applied to the farm shepherds of the era. As there was no breed club or registry until later, there is some dispute over exactly which name applies to which dogs. Australian Shepherd is likely a derivative of these farm dogs and appeared primarily in the Western United States. The English Shepherd on the other hand was more common in the Midwest and East. These dogs are primarily descendants of the working farm dogs of England.
As the small diversified farms in the mid-western and eastern United States dwindled in numbers, many of them replaced by larger and less diversified operations, the English Shepherd became a rare breed.
