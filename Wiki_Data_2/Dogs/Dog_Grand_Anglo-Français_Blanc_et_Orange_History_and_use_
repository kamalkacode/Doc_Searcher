== History and use ==
Grand Anglo-Français Blanc et Orange is descended from crosses between the Billy and Foxhounds in the late 1800s. The names of all the various Anglo-French hound breeds and varieties were all officially described with the term "Anglo-Français" in 1957. They are used as a pack dog to hunt large game such as roe deer, boar, or smaller animals such as fox. Although these are large dogs, "Grand" does not necessarily refer to the size of the dogs. "In most cases it is simply a label for a pack that is used for larger game".Grand Anglo-Français Blanc et Orange is recognised in its country of origin by the Société Centrale Canine (French Kennel Club) and internationally by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in Group 6, Scenthounds. It is bred and kept primarily as a hunting dog, not as a pet or showdog. The breed has been exported to North America, where it is recognised by the United Kennel Club in its Scenthound Group. It is also registered by minor kennel clubs and internet dog registry businesses, and is promoted as a rare breed for those seeking a unique pet.
