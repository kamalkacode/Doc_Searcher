=== Temperament ===
The Artois Hound is an energetic dog that is brave and loyal. Though it has a large amount of endurance, it is calm and well balanced. It is a moderate sized dog that will feature the best characteristics of the scenthounds. It has a powerful sense of smell, and it is fast and independent. These dogs were bred to hunt rabbits, and they are proficient at this task. These dogs need to be trained by owners who are consistent. They are affectionate and loving to those that care for them. Like all scent hounds they are happiest when on the trail of a good scent.


==== Hunting ====
The Artois Hound, (a Briquet, (of a small type)), is nowadays used especially in hunting with guns, and on horseback.  It drives the game closer taking advantage of their faults with ingenuity; its speed is average but maintained.

In general countryside : Because of its acute sense of smell, it is capable of outmanoeuvring many of its prey's tactics.
In woodland areas : With its ancestral qualities of a hunter, in sparse and well scattered groups of tall trees, it can hunt a deer efficiently, and in the desired direction of its owner.
In the thicket : its intrepidity and bravery means that it can stir up and even the most obstinate boars.
Additional points: It is a robust animal with a high pitched call which can be heard from as far away as 2 km.
