Like all purebred dogs, it has its share of health problems, but careful breeding is helping the situation cease.


=== Life expectancy ===
In 2004, The Kennel Club in the United Kingdom conducted a breed health survey [1] which found the average life expectancy of Italian Spinone to be 8.7 years.


=== Known medical issues ===
Cerebellar ataxia: Cerebellar ataxia (CA) is a deadly hereditary condition that is known to affect Spinone puppies. It is a recessive gene; therefore, both sire and dam must have been carriers for any pup in a litter to have this condition. No puppy with CA has lived past the age of 12 months to date. Most puppies that have been diagnosed with the condition are euthanised at 10â€“11 months.  However, the AHT (UK) has developed a test for this condition.  Carriers can now be identified to a 95% certainty.
Hip dysplasia: Like some large breeds, the Spinone can suffer hip dysplasia. This is when the hip bones develop abnormally. Abnormal joint motion causes early onset arthritis  and makes it difficult and painful to do any exercise. Dogs diagnosed with severe hip dysplasia can have one of a number or surgical repairs including removal of the femoral head (FHO), surgical remodeling of the joint (triple pelvic osteotomy) or total hip replacement (implant of an artificial femoral head(ball) and acetabulum (socket)).
