== Description ==
The Brussels Griffon is typically a small breed with a sturdy frame.  The average adult Griffon stands from 9 to 11 inches (230–280 mm) tall, and weighs 8 to 10 pounds (4–5 kg).  They have domed heads, short noses, and an underbite.  Their human-like facial features are often likened to that of an Ewok.The Griffon comes in two coat variants, wiry/rough and smooth coat.  Their hair (not fur) can be red, black and tan, or black and reddish in color.  The short hair Griffon requires little grooming while the wiry/rough coat Griffon requires weekly grooming attention.


=== Temperament ===
The Griffon Bruxellois is known to have a huge heart, and a strong desire to snuggle and be with its master. They display a visible air of self-importance. A Griffon should not be shy or aggressive, but they are very emotionally sensitive, and because of this, should be socialized carefully at a young age. Griffons should also be alert, inquisitive and interested in their surroundings.
Griffons tend to bond with one human more than others. In fact, Griffons are very good with children provided they are not teased.  They are not very patient but do love to play. Griffons tend to get along well with other animals in the house, including cats, ferrets, and other dogs.  However, they can get into trouble because they have no concept of their own relative size and may attempt to dominate dogs much larger than themselves.
