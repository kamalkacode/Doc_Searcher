== History ==
For a long time the Pyrenean Mastiff accompanied the herds of sheep in its migratory paths from the Aragonese and Navarrese Pyrenees until Maestrazgo. Its main function was to guard and protect the herds and its masters from the attacks of wolves, bears and thieves.
During the 20th century, especially after the Spanish Civil War, due to economic difficulties, the mastiff went into decline as it was very expensive to keep a dog of its size. In the 1970s a group of fans started a job of recovery of the breed through the few specimens that were in the countryside and still had typical features of the ancient mastiff.  It has been documented since 1977 as a modern purebred breed by the Club del Mastín del Pirineo de España in Spain.The mountain dog breed is now being taken from its native region and promoted as a pet in other countries like USA by the Pyrenean Mastiffs USA Club. It was recognised by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in 1982. The Pyrenean Mastiffs USA Club is actively working on AKC recognition within the United States.
