Black Mouth Curs are great family dogs. They are very social dogs if trained properly. The BMC is an "extremely smart" breed who "by nature need to bond a few weeks" with their owner/trainer before training can begin.  They are also very sensitive dogs that are very attuned to their master's voice and should never be yelled at in anger or spanked.  BMC's make good family dogs as long as they have access to at least an acre of yard and can access it throughout the day.  This dog will not be happy spending the day on the couch alone. They are very social dogs and need a human companion and daily routines where they are allowed to sprint.  These are not couch dogs and must have access to several hours of exercise daily to avoid anxiety and depression.   "The BMC was bred as a homestead dog that would protect its family and home against intruders. This means that a well-bred BMC is territorial. Most BMCs off their 'turf' work well with other dogs, hunting or herding stock, but on their family property will chase the same dog away. Their turf can be viewed by the dog as the familyâ€™s home, land, truck, or sometimes proximity to 'their person'."
