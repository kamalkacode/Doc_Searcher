== The German spitz type ==
Since there not just one German spitz breed, German spitz (pluralized as a spitzes or, from German, as spitzen) can also be considered a subtype of the spitz broader dog type. Dogs descended or bred from various German spitzes are included in this grouping.

The Wolfspitz, also called the Keeshond, is registered as a separate breed by the Kennel Club (UK) and other registries.
The Großspitz (Grossespitz) or Giant Spitz is 46 ± 4 centimetres (18.1 ± 1.6 in) high and weighs 15 to 20 kilograms (33 to 44 lb). The Wolfspitz and the Giant Spitz are divided primarily by colour, though the Keeshond tends to have a fuller coat and is taller and heavier.
The Mittelspitz, also Medium Spitz or Standard Spitz, is the ancestor of, and is sometimes taken to include, the American Eskimo Dog. The latter is allowed to be registered as Mittelspitz by some registries. Only the Canadian Kennel Club and the two major American kennel clubs recognize the American Eskimo Dog as a separate breed.
The German Spitz Klein, sometimes known as the Kleinspitz or Miniature Spitz, is allowed more colours than the larger German spitz varieties, under the Fédération Cynologique Internationale standard. The Japanese Spitz, also bred from German spitz stock, is very similar to the Spitz Klein but is limited to the white colour and has a different breed history.
The Zwergspitz, also called the Pomeranian, is also registered as a separate breed in the UK and North America.The Kennel Club (UK) and the Australian Kennel Club recognize only the Kleinspitz and Mittelspitz. In those countries, the Grossespitz is not recognized, and the Pomeranian (Zwergspitz) and Keeshond (Wolfspitz) are separate breeds. In many countries the Miniature (Klein) Spitz is also confused with the Pomeranian (Zwergspitz). Some registries and breed clubs allow various sizes of German spitzes to be interbred, others do not.
