== Portuguese Podengo Pequeno ==


=== Appearance ===
The Portuguese Podengo Pequeno is characterized by a wedge shaped head, with erect ears and a curved tail. The AKC breed standards include the following points: 

Height: 8 to 12 in (20 to 30 cm)
Weight: 9 to 13 lb (4.1 to 5.9 kg)
Color: yellow or fawn
Coat: wire coat (a rough, single coat â€” no undercoat; does shed but not very much) or smooth coat (a dense smooth coat with undercoat that is low maintenance. It naturally sheds dust and dirt and dries very quickly)


=== Temperament ===
Podengo Pequeno are small, friendly, hardy, lively and intelligent companions. They are very active and usually good with children and other animals when socialized from an early age. They enjoy time with their human family.
Like their Medio relatives, they are very watchful and observant and will bark when something gets their attention. They enjoy running and sunshine and must have a secure enclosed fence. The Podengo Pequeno is trained well with positive techniques and should be kept on leash all of the time during training as they can be quite autonomous and have their own ideas about what constitutes proper behavior. They can be remarkably silly in the home. A walk with many Pequenos can be a delight and they will continually come back to the owner to make sure they are coming along.


=== History ===
The Portuguese Podengo Pequeno accompanied Portuguese explorers on their ships for ratting purposes after the Portuguese completed the reconquest of their country from the Moors in the 13th century.
Wire Coat Pequenos were first shown in the United States in 2001 when Chicharro de Viamonte, owned by Marilyn Piurek and Kip Bergstrom, was exhibited at an ARBA show in Boston. He was the first Podengo to ever be shown in the United States and the first Podengo Pequeno champion in ARBA and Rarities. Smooth coat Pequenos were first shown in the United States in 2003. The Viamonte podengos were the first family of Podengos pequenos in the United States, followed by Gelado de Viamonte "Chico" in 2004. Wire Coat Pequenos were first imported to the UK in 2002. The smooth coated Pequeno followed in 2004. Most (75%)of the purebred Portuguese Podengos in the United States consist of the Pequeno size, and most of these (85%) are of the wire coat variety.
