In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, these dogs were common on farms across America. They were called shepherds or collies. After World War II, people's fancies turned to registered dogs and the farm shepherds began a slow decline. By the 1980s, farm shepherds were almost extinct in America, McDuffie then began a nationwide search for the dogs he remembered from his youth using his column in Full Cry Magazine as a vehicle to reach out to others. From the hundreds of responses he received, he eventually located a family in Central Tennessee who had kept a line of these dogs pure for generations. In the spring of 1994 McDuffie drove to Brush Creek, Tennessee and bought the last litter of 4 pups produced by this family. McDuffie found another line of farm shepherds in Western Tennessee where he acquired 2 females. With these 6 dogs, McDuffie founded the Old Time Farm Shepherd breed and began registering them with the National Kennel Club.As of October 2010 McDuffie's dog, Dunrovin's Ole Shep had contributed to the pedigrees of over 30 of the 135 registered working farm collies of the American Working Farmcollie Association, more than any other single dog. Most of these descendants registered as English Shepherd.
