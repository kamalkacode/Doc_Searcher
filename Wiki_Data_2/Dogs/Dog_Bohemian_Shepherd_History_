== History ==
Chodský pes is an old sheepdog breed. They have been also guarding Bohemian southwestern borders and homes in the area of the Chod region (around Domažlice town). "Chodové" (the Chods), the local people living there, had an exceptional permission to hold large dogs for this purpose. Alois Jirásek, writing about a brave uprising of the local people, even assigned these dogs as a flag symbol of them. Though that is actually incorrect, the symbol became part of national knowledge due to drawings of a well known Czech painter Mikoláš Aleš. The symbol of the Chodský pes is still on Czech young scouts badges.
As the breed of chodský pes is old, it is possibly also one of the predecessors to the German Shepherd. Chodský pes is known to have existed in the Czech lands as far back as the 14th century, and having been professionally bred as early as the 16th century, centuries before the Germans decided to try to make their own national breed. A modern breeding program for this dog was started in 1984 and there are now many breeders. About 3500 registered pups have been born since the program started (1984–2009). Therefore, there is no proof that they are related to German Shepherds.
