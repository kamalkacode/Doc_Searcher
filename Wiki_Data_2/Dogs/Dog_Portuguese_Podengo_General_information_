== General information ==
The Grande (large) was developed for deer and wild boar hunting. It will exhaust and hold down the prey and await the hunter's gun. The Grande is now very rare in its home country.The Medio (medium) was developed for rabbit chasing, flushing, hunting and retrieval. Its hunting style includes catlike stalking and, similar to the Ibizan Hound, it often jumps above the prey before landing on or near it to flush it out of dense brush, rock crevices or burrows. It will dig if necessary to flush prey.The Pequeno (small) was also developed for flushing rabbits from cover. It is also a good mouser and was probably kept on board explorer ships when the Portuguese initiated the European worldwide explorations in the 15th and 16th centuries.In the United States, the United Kennel Club (UKC) represents the breed as shown in Portugal and all FCI countries — the three sizes, all with two coat varieties — as one breed. The American Kennel Club (AKC) has divided the breed into the Portuguese Podengo Pequeno and the Portuguese Podengo (includes the Medio and Grande size). This breed Portuguese Podengo is represented by the American Portuguese Podengo Medio/Grande Club. The Pequeno entered the AKC Misc class in January 2011 and entered the Hound Class in January 2013.  The Portuguese Podengo (which includes the Medio and Grande), will enter AKC Miscellaneous Class on January 1, 2014.
