The breed was a freckled white dog with either liver or black markings, the breed standard in 1859 set their measurements at 17–18 inches (43–46 cm) in height at the withers. It had long legs, feathered ears, a white area on forehead, which was said to "[add] a great deal to his beauty",  but there were differences from the English Springer, including a broader skull and shorter neck. It was also compared to the English Setter in its build, shape, and proportions, although it was a much smaller size. While other field spaniels of this era displayed colours other than liver and white or liver and black, the Norfolk did not. The breed-specific qualities varied greatly as in some places the breeding lines were not kept particularly pure, those lines having had stock from Sussex and Clumber Spaniels bred into them.By the end of the 19th century the description of a Norfolk Spaniel had changed slightly, The Spaniel Club breed standard for a Norfolk Spaniel in 1897 was for the animal to have a coat of either black and white or liver and white which was not curly, a reasonably heavy body and legs which are longer than other field spaniels but shorter than the Irish Water Spaniel, a deep chest with long sloping shoulders and strength in the back and loins, as well as features typical of a spaniel such as lobular ears. This standard also included the requirement for the tail to be docked. In brief, the standard described the Norfolk as simply looking like a large cocker spaniel.
