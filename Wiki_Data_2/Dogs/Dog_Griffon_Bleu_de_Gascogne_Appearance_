== Appearance ==
The Griffon Bleu de Gascogne is a medium-large dog, 50 to 57 cm (10.5-22.4 ins) at the withers, with a distinctive rough (shaggy) blue speckled coat, drop ears that are not as long as those on other hounds, and a tail carried up and in a slight curve.
The colour of the Griffon Bleu de Gascogne's coat is the same as the Grand Bleu de Gascogne, white mottled with black, giving a slate blue overall appearance. There are black patches on either side of the head, with a white area on top of the head which has in it a small black oval. Tan "eyebrow" marks are over each eye give a 'quatreoeuill√©' (four-eyed) effect, and tan is found on the cheeks, inside the ears, on the legs, and under the tail. Texture of the coat should be hard and rough, a little shorter on the head than on the body.Faults are deviations in appearance or temperament that have an effect on the health and working ability of the dog, as well as an absence of expected features of colour, structure, and size, indicating that a dog with such faults should not be bred. Faults include timidity, soft topline, snipey muzzle, cowhocked, splayed feet, and a wolley coat.
