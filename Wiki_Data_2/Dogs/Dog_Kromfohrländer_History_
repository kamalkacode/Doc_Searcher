== History ==
The Kromfohrlander originated in Germany in the 1940s. It is the only dog breed descended from a military mascot dog. 'Original Peter' was found in France by  American soldiers during World War 2. Peter came to Germany with his troop and was lost. He was discovered by Ilsa Schleifenbaum, who developed the breed using various dogs (most likely terrier and griffon type breeds) for 10 years.
The Kromfohrlander was first recognized by FCI for showing in 1955.
The Kromfohrlander came to Scandinavia starting in the early 1970s, assisted by Ilsa Schleifenbaum.
The first smooth Kromfohrlander, a male named Button von der Britzer Muele, came to North America (United States of America/USA) from Germany in 1997 when he was 2 years old. He sired the first smooth Kromfohrlander litter born in the USA in 2000. He sired a second smooth Kromfohrlander litter in 2004. Each litter produced 2 puppies, all of which were kept by the breeders and none of whom reproduced.
The first rough Kromfohrlander came to North America (USA) from Germany in 1998. He was never bred.
No other Kromfohrlanders brought to North America between 2004-2016 were ever bred.
