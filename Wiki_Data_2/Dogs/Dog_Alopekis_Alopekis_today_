== Alopekis today ==


=== Problems ===
This charismatic, multi-purpose and ancient breed of dog is valued as a unique example of small canine evolution. However, their traditionally healthy gene pool has been threatened in modern times by urbanisation, farming pesticides, cross-breeding with foreign imported dogs and the lacking of a registering body. Although there is no specific data on the impact of this zoonosis on Alopekis populations, endemic proportions of the seasonal leishmaniasis infection are believed to be responsible as well. Exacerbating the problem are the low number of puppies per litter, the high mortality of newborn puppies in the rural environment, as well as the single-oestrus per year status of the breed. Also, despite the endangered status of the breed, many Alopekis have been neutered as a result of indiscriminate policies designed to curb the increase in the number of stray dogs. A group of scientists led by veterinary surgeon Prof. Spyros Chleiounakis have been monitoring a local population of the breed in a specific area of Northern Greece since 2005. The recent publication of their study and subsequent articles in the Greek and foreign press in February 2013, call for the protection of the last few pure Alopekis left in Greece.


=== Conservation effort ===
A small group of dog lovers and canine historians and connoisseurs that have been championing the case for the small native breeds since the 1970s and '80s and have contributed, in 2004, to the successful recognition of one of these, the Kokoni, by the Kennel Club of Greece, is trying, in co-operation with Amaltheia volunteers, to attract attention to the plight of the Alopekis and the looming danger of extinction.
