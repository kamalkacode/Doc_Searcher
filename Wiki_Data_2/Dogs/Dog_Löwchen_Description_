== Description ==

The  Löwchen's coat is long and flowing and comes in many colours. The coat should not be thin and fluffy like a Bichon Frise, but wavy with a mix of thicker hairs amongst the fine ones. This allows for a flowing coat that is not frizzy or fly-away, and a Löwchen coat should not be harsh like many terriers. The Löwchen does not shed, and this breed has very low allergic effects, and is considered hypoallergenic.The head of the Löwchen is one of its most important features, with its relatively short, wide muzzle, broad skull, lively round eyes, and pendulant ears. They can come in all colours, including brown, that allow for dark eyes and nose. The head, when in proportion to the body, is neither too big nor too small, but helps to emphasize the friendly, regal, and leonine personality of the Löwchen. The litter size is usually between three and six puppies. The Löwchen's life span is around 12–14 years.


=== Lion cut ===

 
The Löwchen's long and wavy coat is presented in a lion cut. This means that the haunches, back legs, front legs (except bracelets around the ankles), and the 1/3–1/2 of the tail closest to the body are shaved, and the rest of the coat is left natural to give the dog the appearance of a male lion. The lion cut is the traditional way of presenting these dogs but it is not known where the practice comes from. Dogs in lion clip may need some protection in wintertime on the shaved parts.


=== Temperament ===
The Löwchen is a friendly, healthy and happy dog. Dogs of this breed are both active and playful, and very intelligent. The Löwchen is an excellent house pet.  The Löwchen makes also a good pet for families with children. This breed has a history as a companion dog and the dogs need the attention of humans and they are not happy left alone for longer periods of time.
