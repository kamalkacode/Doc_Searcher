== Description ==
Like all Belgian Shepherds, the Groenendael is a medium-sized, hard-working, square-proportioned dog, in the sheepdog family. The Groenendael is recognized by its distinctive black coat.


=== Appearance ===

The Groenendael should be athletic, strong, imposing, rustic, and balanced in appearance. It should look natural, never as though it has been prepared just for the show ring. Its coat should be profuse, but never look as though it would inhibit the dog's working ability in any way. The colour is always black, with sometimes small white markings being allowed on the chest,chin and feet. Floppy ears are considered a fault when showing. When being shown, its handler should never have to force it into position; ideally the handler should not have to touch the dog at all.


==== Size ====
The Groenendael should be 60–66 centimetres (24–26 in) at the withers for males, and 56–62 centimetres (22–24 in) for females. The weight should be approximately 25–30 kilograms (55–66 lb) for males, and 20–25 kilograms (44–55 lb) for females.


==== Coat ====
The Groenendael has a thick, double coat. The texture should be hard and dense, never woolly, silky, frizzy, fine, or wiry. The undercoat should be thick and profuse. In conformation shows, dogs without an undercoat are heavily penalized.


=== Temperament ===

The Groenendael is intelligent, active, loyal and quietly affectionate. Groenendaels are not a breed for the faint of heart. However, for those who have plenty of time, energy, confidence and love, they are wonderful friends. Training and socializing is essential. They are wary of strangers and protective. They love children as long as they are introduced to them at an early age. The Groenendael bonds deeply to its people and cannot live outdoors or in a kennel. It needs to spend time with its family every day and may experience separation anxiety if left alone for long periods of time.
