A UK survey based on the lifespan of 96 Bullmastiffs found a median age of 7.5 years. A Bullmastiff does not stop growing until it is about three and a half years of age.
Health concerns within the breed include hip and elbow dysplasia, progressive retinal atrophy, bloat, and cancer, with a relatively high incidence of lymphoma and mast cell tumours. Bullmastiffs are prone to certain hereditary diseases, including:

Hip dysplasia, affecting 24.5% of individuals 
Elbow dysplasia, affecting 13.8% of individuals,
Entropion, hypothyroidism affecting 2.8% of individuals,
Lymphoma
Progressive retinal atrophy is a particular problem, since the trait is an autosomal dominant one. (This has recently been called into question by another medical team and has been proven that some Bullmastiffs have autosomal recessive PRA genes. In America, this is being investigated by the American Bullmastiff Health and Research Committee, and the DNA Optigen test only works for dominant genes, so it is considered inadequate at this time.)
Arthritis
Gastric dilatation volvulus, also known as bloat.Cosmetic genetic problems include longhairs and "Dudleys". Both are recessives and not common. The Dudley, named after a notable Bulldog breeder of the 19th century, the Earl of Dudley, is a lack of pigment in the mask. It can be liver colored or simply not present.
