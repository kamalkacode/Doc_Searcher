== Description ==
The Black Mouth Cur is a well-muscled rugged herding, hunting, and all around utility (or work) dog whose coat comes in a number of colors and shades, generally all shades of fawn from nearly white to mahogany.  Solid white and piebald colors are not allowed in Black Mouth Curs, but in rare occasions may appear in a litter due to recessive genes from several generations back matching up. According to the breed standard of the United Kennel Club, up to ten percent of the coat may be white with the amounts of white on the toes, tail, nose and chest are acceptable but not desired. As of this date the Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Cur is recognized by UKC as the Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dog and the Plott Cur has been renamed the Plott Hound. 
The name "cur" is a descriptive term for a general, short-coated, drop-eared, farm and ranch working dog. Black Mouth Curs are primarily herding dogs able to hunt big or small game, but they are also suitable as family dogs. The breed has an average litter size of 3-12, and a lifespan of 12â€“18 years.
