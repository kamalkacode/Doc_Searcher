=== Deafness ===
Deafness is one of the major genetic traits in Catahoulas and associated with individuals that are excessively white in color and deafness attributed to a lack of melanocytes. A Catahoula that is predominantly white has an 80% chance of being bi-laterally deaf or uni-laterally hearing. Hearing in one ear is referred to as "directional deafness". Breeders are often unwilling to allow deaf Catahoulas to leave their premises and will generally euthanize deaf pups.
Puppies born from a litter where both parents have the "Merle" color pattern have a 25% chance of being born blind, deaf or blind and deaf. These puppies are often referred to as "Double Merles". A double merle can come from any breed, or breed mix. As long as both parents are merle, each puppy has a chance of being born with these traits.


=== Hip dysplasia ===
A concern with many breeds, hip dysplasia is dependent on the gene pool and good breeders. The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals and PennHIP can help determine whether a specific individual is prone to hip dysplasia through radiographs. According the OFA - roughly 20% (or 1 in 5) Catahoulas have Hip dysplasia.
