It is generally believed that the ancestors of the Japanese Terrier were brought by Dutch merchant ships to Nagasaki, the only Japanese port open to the West in the 17th century.  It is unclear whether these dogs were Dutch Boerenfox (a Dutch terrier strain, like the Fox Terrier of England or the German Pinscher of Germany) or whether these were dogs brought along by English sailors.  Unlike other descendants of Fox Terriers, the JT seems to have been developed exclusively as a pet.  The dogs became very popular as lap dogs in ports such as Nagasaki, Kobe and Yokohama.According to the Japan Kennel Club (JKC), planned breeding of Japanese Terriers did not begin until around 1920, when fanciers began selective breeding from the progenitor, the Kobe Terrier.  The Japanese Terrier was recognized by the JKC in 1930. The Japanese Terrier is recognized by the Japan Kennel Club and the FCI.  It is little known outside Japan, but does have its admirers in Europe.Although this dog goes by the name of Japanese Terrier it is actually not included in the group of Japanese Spitz. The Japanese Spitz group includes six distinctive dogs such as the Hokkaido Inu, the Shiba Inu, the Akita Inu, the Kai Ken, Kishu Inu, and the Shikoku Inu.
