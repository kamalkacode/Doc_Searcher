== History ==
The Terceira Mastiff comes from the isle of Terceira, located in the Azores. It descends from local dogs, old Spanish and English mastiffs and bulldogs, the Dogue de Bordeaux and the Bloodhound. According to a legend, it once was very popular among the pirates of the region and soon became a popular fighting dog as well. In the 1880s, veterinarian Dr. Jose Leite Pacheco wrote the first breed standard and intended to make the nickname rabo torto as the official name of the breed instead of the c√£o de fila da Terceira. Unfortunately, the Terceira Mastiff was already extremely endangered that time, which was one of the reasons why - despite of the Portuguese standard - it was never accepted by the FCI.
In the 1960s, there was an attempt to revive the breed with the aid of the Portuguese government. However, there was disagreement between government officials and breeders, which led to the project's failure. After this, the future of the Terceira Mastiff depended solely on local farmers and breed fanciers. In the 1970s, it was already declared extinct, although there were still some individuals left in the Azores. With these few individuals, the recreation of the breed finally begun.
