== Breed history ==
Geographical locale favoured the development of various types of the Kuchi dog. For example, in mountainous regions, the heavier coated and large boned dogs were preferred, while in a desert environment - a lighter, more agile build was more desirable. Natural selection occurred due to environmental conditions, as well as human preferences.
Over the centuries, the breeds that ‘settled’ would become associated with that region, and some have even received names and international kennel breed status. The Kangal dog of Turkey, the Caucasian Ovtcharka in the Caucasus region, and many other breeds, such as the large shepherd breeds of Europe, all belong to this group of dogs.
The Central Asian Ovtcharka or "CAO" is a variant created by Russian breeders desiring to classify a highly varied group of dogs of Central Asia into a ‘breed standard' which would allow the dogs to be graded when judged in competition at popular dog shows. This variant often appears as a large-bodied, heavier-headed, more uniform type; both in colour (often white), coat texture (shorter—less variety) and body type. There is a significant divergence of type from the native Kuchi dogs to the show-winning Srednoaziatska Ovcharka.
The Kuchi dogs have not changed their basic phenotype over the same period of time; often appearing to be diverse in colour, head type, body mass and coat type. The Kuchi dogs need to work with their owners, fulfilling their duties. Otherwise they may act out their frustrations and lack of sense of purpose in ways that can be unacceptable to their owners and the rest of society. They are still a very primitive breed; the Kuchi dog has natural guarding instincts that are not for the show ring as purely working lines.
