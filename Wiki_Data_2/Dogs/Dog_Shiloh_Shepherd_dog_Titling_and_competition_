Using their speed and balance, Shilohs perform agility related activities with ease.  However, due to slower bone growth they should not perform strenuous obstacles or jumping until they reach maturity.
Shilohs have herding instincts that make them excellent partners in the  arena.  Shilohs have been recognized by the American Herding Breed Association (AHBA) since 2004.  The AHBA's preliminary test for Herding Instinct is used to determine if a Shiloh has the instincts and interest for herding.Shilohs have been trained as search and rescue dogs.  In March 2007, a Shiloh named Gandalf received national media attention after finding a Boy Scout lost in the mountains of North Carolina.

Shilohs' gentleness and calm temperament allow them to be a part of therapy work. Their intelligence and willingness to please make them highly suitable for work as assistance dogs. They respond quickly to training and retain the capacity to make independent decisions when situations change.   They are frequent recipients of the AKCs "Canine Good Citizen" Award and have been awarded the Companion Dog title, the Companion Dog Excellent title, the Utility Dog title and been certified as Reading Education Assistance Dogs.Shilohs are easy to handle and even children can be successful in the show ring.  Currently Shilohs can be shown in the American Rare Breed Association, the International All Breed Canine Association, Rarities Inc., the Rare Breed Club of South Western Ontario, the National Kennel Club, and the National Canine Association, as well as special shows by two Shiloh dog clubs and an annual homecoming held by the breed founder.
