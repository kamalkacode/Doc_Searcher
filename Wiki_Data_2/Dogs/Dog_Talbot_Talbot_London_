In December 1919 A Darracq and Company (1905) Limited of London with its factory in Suresnes, Paris, bought the entire capital of Clément-Talbot and later bought Sunbeam and renamed itself S. T. D. Motors Limited. Those initials referred to Sunbeam, Talbot and Darracq. But in the depth of the Great Depression S T D Motors became unable to pay its debts. Its subsidiaries managed to find buyers and in 1936 S T D Motors ceased to exist.

Following the financial collapse of its parent, S T D Motors, Clément-Talbot remained financially sound with readily marketable products.
