The Basset Artésien Normand and the more familiar Basset Hound share a common ancestry in the short-legged hounds of northern France of the early 19th century that displayed achondroplasia dwarfism. But unlike the Basset Hound, which was developed by English breeders in the late 19th century as a more substantial dog that was initially cross-bred with Bloodhounds, the Basset-type dogs that French breeders developed remained lighter-boned and more focused on hunting ability.
Documenting of these French Bassets as a purebred breed began in 1870, and from a common ancestral type, two strains were developed. One had straight front legs (Basset d'Artois) and the other had crooked front legs (Normand). The breed club was formed in 1910 and the breed was given its present name in 1924.Bassets are walking hounds, which are followed by the hunter on foot. The short legs mean that they would not get too far away from the hunter. The Basset Artésien Normand was used to hunt rabbits and other small game alone or in packs, but today they are primarily bred to be pets.
