== History and use ==
Grand Anglo-Français Blanc et Noir is descended from crosses between the old Saintongeois hound and Foxhounds, a type called the Bâtard Anglo-Saintongeois. The names of all the various Anglo-French hound breeds and varieties were all officially described with the term "Anglo-Français" in 1957. They are used as a pack dog to hunt large game such as roe deer, boar, or smaller animals such as fox. Although these are large dogs, "Grand" does not necessarily refer to the size of the dogs. "In most cases it is simply a label for a pack that is used for larger game".Grand Anglo-Français Blanc et Noir is recognised in its country of origin by the Société Centrale Canine (French Kennel Club) and internationally by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in Group 6, Scenthounds. In France it is bred and kept primarily as a hunting dog, not as a pet or showdog, and there are "twenty or more" working packs and around 2000 registered dogs. The breed has been exported to North America, where it is recognised by the United Kennel Club in its Scenthound Group. It is also registered by minor kennel clubs and Internet dog registry businesses, and is promoted as a rare breed for those seeking a unique pet.
