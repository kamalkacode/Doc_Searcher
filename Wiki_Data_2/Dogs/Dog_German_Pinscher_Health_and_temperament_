=== Temperament ===

A German Pinscher should be an alert, good natured and playful dog. They are known for being very loyal, watchful and fearless. A well-bred German Pinscher will be a loving companion with an even temperament.  When considering adding a German Pinscher to a family, it is advised to be able to meet and touch the mother of the puppy you are offered.
German Pinschers are very energetic working dogs, in many cases requiring several hours of exercise a day. Accordingly, a large, securely fenced yard is highly recommended for anyone considering the breed as a pet and the owner to be mindful of training them appropriately. Socialization from puppyhood is a must, as high prey drive is common in the breed so in a city environment they need to learn to control their impulses. This does, however, make them a great fetch companion.


=== Health ===
Due to the small gene pool of the German Pinscher, breeders should health test their dogs for hereditary cataracts, hip dysplasia and elbow dysplasia, von Willebrand disease, thyroid disorder, and with the increased incidences of cardiac disease due to irresponsible breeding practices, German Pinschers suspect for heart issues should be removed from all breeding programs.
