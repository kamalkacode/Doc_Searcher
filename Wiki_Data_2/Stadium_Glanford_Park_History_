== History ==
Scunthorpe United originally played at the Old Showground, which was located towards the centre of the town at the junction of Doncaster Road and Henderson Avenue. In the wake of the Bradford City disaster of 1985, it was determined that substantial improvements would have to be made to the Old Showground in order for it to meet new regulations, improvements which the club could not afford. Ultimately it was decided that the best course of action was to relocate to a new out of town site, with the sale of the land occupied by the Old Showground being used to raise much needed revenue for the club. After the club relocated, the Old Showground was demolished and replaced by a Safeway supermarket, which was subsequently sold to Sainsbury's in 2004.Construction began during 1987 on a site located on the outskirts of Scunthorpe, close to the start of the M181 motorway and approximately 1.5 miles West of the Old Showground. The ground was fully completed prior to the commencement of the 1988–89 season and was officially opened at the start of the season by Princess Alexandra. Upon its completion, it was the first new Football League stadium in England for 33 years.Glanford Park originally opened with a capacity of 11,190, both of the goal-ends being standing terraces, however this capacity was later reduced to its current value of 9,088 in 1991.The name Glanford Park was derived from its funding by the then Glanford Borough Council, before North Lincolnshire became a unitary authority.
For all but one of its first 17 seasons (1999–2000), the stadium staged fourth tier football prior to Scunthorpe’s promotion to League One in 2005, since when they have appeared in either League One or the Football League Championship for all but one season (2013–14).
Premier League side Manchester City visited Glanford Park on 24 January 2010, in the FA Cup Fourth Round. City won the match 4–2, which saw Robinho score his final goal in English football.The record attendance is 9,077 for a 5–2 loss against Manchester United in the League Cup on 22 September 2010.The record attendance for a Football League game stands at 8,921 for a 2–1 win over Newcastle United in the Championship, coming on 20 October 2009.
